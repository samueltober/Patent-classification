 JPB To provide a spring seat which can prevent entry of a liquid from the lower surface side while maintaining the ability of draining the liquid accumulated at the upper surface side and to provide a bearing deviceSOLUTION A spring seat  functions as a spring seat of a coil spring of a strut type suspension having a shock absorber and the coil spring and includes an upper surface  located at the side of an upper mount for attaching the strut type suspension to a vehicle body a lower surface  located at the coil spring side and drain holes  which penetrate through the upper surface  and the lower surface  and drain the liquid at the upper surface  side to the lower surface  side The drain hole  has a small diameter part  located at the upper surface  side and a large diameter part  wich is located at the lower surface  side and has an inner diameter larger than the small diameter part  The small diameter part  and the large diameter part  are connected in a manner such that axes C C thereof are offset from each otherSELECTED DRAWING Figure
