 EPA An elastomeric bearing  includes an inner member  that has a spherical exterior surface and is symmetric about a central axis C and a hollow annular outer structure  that is axially split thereby forming a first outer segment A and a second outer segment B The first outer segment A and second outer segment B form a substantially cylindrical exterior surface One or more shim structures   are formed around the inner member  and are disposed at least partially inside the hollow annular outer structure The shim structure   has a radially outward facing surface and a radially inward facing surface One or more layers    of elastomeric material are disposed on each of the radially outward facing surface and the radially inward facing surface
