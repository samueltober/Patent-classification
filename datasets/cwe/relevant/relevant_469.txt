 JPA To provide a bearing device for a wheel capable of notifying a driver of abnormality when the abnormality such as separation and abrasion occurs on an outer raceway surface disposed on an outer member and an inner raceway surface disposed on an inner memberSOLUTION In a bearing device  for a wheel including a slinger metallic ring  including a cylindrical portion a fitted to an inner ring  of an inner member  and a vertical plate portion b extended radially outward from the cylindrical portion a a magnetic encoder  disposed on the vertical plate portion b and a rotating speed sensor  disposed axially in opposition to the magnetic encoder  the slinger  is composed of a shape memory alloy the vertical plate portion b is deformed to a side separating from the rotating speed sensor  when the slinger  is over a shape recovery temperature and change of a magnetic flux density of the magnetic encoder  due to the deformation is detected by the rotating speed sensor SELECTED DRAWING Figure
