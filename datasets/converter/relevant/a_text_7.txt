 EPA This chopper circuit  performs voltage conversion between a first DC voltage at a first external connection terminal and a second DC voltage at a second external connection terminal and is provided with a first switch portion  having the first external connection terminal a second switch portion  connected in series with the first switch portion  so that the conducting direction during ONtime matches that of the first switch portion  and having the second external connection terminal on the opposite side to the side where the first switch portion  is connected one or a plurality of semiconductor power converters  cascadeconnected to each other which are provided on a wire branched from the wire for connecting the first switch portion  and the second switch portion  and an inductor  connected in series with the semiconductor power converters  on the wire branched from the wire for connecting the first switch portion  and the second switch portion
