 CNA A system for controlling a suspension of a vehicle includes a plurality of sensors an antiroll moment module configured to determine a fronttototal antiroll moment distribution based on at leasta first operating parameter of the vehicle at least one suspension actuator and a suspension control module configured to control the at least one suspension actuator based on the determined fronttototal antiroll moment distribution A method of producing an antiroll moment distribution module for a vehicle includes determining understeer characteristics of the vehicle determining a maximumlateral acceleration of the vehicle adjusting the understeer characteristics based on the determined maximum lateral acceleration determining reference understeer characteristics determining a plurality of reference yaw rates and a plurality of feedforward contributions using a nonlinear quasistatic model of the vehicle storing the reference yaw rates in a first look up table and storing the feedforward contributions in a second look up table
