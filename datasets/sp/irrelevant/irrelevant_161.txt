 CNB This invention discloses a design method of a vehicle rolling motion safety H H controller for active suspension Based on the state equation of a vehicle threefreedom degree steeringrolling motion model reducing the lateral load transfer rate LTR of a vehicle is directly taken as the aim and the suspension rolling angle is limited According to the method when the H H controller is designed LTR is directly used for constructing an H norm and an H norm is used for limiting the rolling angle wherein the maximum of the rolling angle can be determined according to the followingtwo methods  the maximum of the rolling angle is equal to double the suspension limit stroke divided by the suspension mounting distance of the same axle  the maximum of the rolling angle is equal to the determined value obtained when  of passive suspension vehicle rolling angles are not out of limits under the steering situation of double lane change at the travel speed of  kilometersper hour
