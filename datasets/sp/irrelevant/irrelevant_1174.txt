 WOA The invention relates to a power generating dynamoelectric device used on vehicles that allows the permanent up and down movement of the shock absorber to be converted into rotary motion thereby converting the kinetic energy of reciprocating motion into the energy of rotary motion which is then multiplied and converted by means of a generator into direct or alternating current This is accomplished by the fact that the device in question consists of a housing  at a suitable place attached to the vehicle chassis and with a consistent coupler  connected to the movable lever  of the shock absorber  an assembly  for converting the reciprocating motion of the shock absorber  into the rotary motion an assembly   for increasing the number of rotations and an assembly   for coupling the device with a generator for direct current or alternating current which is then used for recharging the battery lighting supply of the heating and cooling device and for recharging the drive batteries of electric vehicles
