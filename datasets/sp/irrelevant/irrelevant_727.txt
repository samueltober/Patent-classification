 CNU The utility model discloses a torsion beam suspension The device comprises an open cross beam a first longitudinal arm a second longitudinal arm and a torsion bar two ends of the open cross beam are respectively connected with the first longitudinal arm and the second longitudinal arm the torsion bar is arranged in the open cross beam two ends of the torsion bar are respectively connected with the first longitudinal arm and the second longitudinal arm the open cross beam comprises a middle section a first transition section a second transition section a first lap joint section and asecond lap joint section The middle section is connected between the first transition section and the second transition section the first lap joint section is connected between the first transitionsection and the first longitudinal arm the second lap joint section is connected between the second transition section and the second longitudinal arm the cross sections of the middle section and the first lap joint section are consistent in shape the cross sections of the second lap joint section and the first lap joint section are consistent in shape the first transition section is in smoothtransition between the first lap joint section and the middle section and the second transition section is in smooth transition between the second lap joint section and the middle section Accordingto the torsion beam suspension on the premise that Zdirection arrangement of the cross beam is not changed the shearing center height of the torsion beam is adjusted within a certain range so as to obtain the optimal whole vehicle control performance
