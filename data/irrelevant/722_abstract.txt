The invention discloses a multimicrogridcontaining power distribution market transaction method based on doublelayer stochastic programming and the method comprises the steps a doublelayer stochastic programming model is built for achieving the optimal resource configuration of a power distribution network and a plurality of microgrids between the power distribution network and the microgrids based on a power transmission network the power distribution network and the microgrids the upperlayer power distribution network operator model simultaneously considers the dayahead realtime twostage scheduling cost of minimizing the resources in the power distribution network and determines the transaction price with the microgrids when meeting the operation constraint condition of the power distribution network the lowerlayer microgrid operator model determines a scheduling scheme and transaction electric quantity with the lowest dayahead realtime twostage operation cost according to the transaction price and the doublelayer stochastic programming model is converted into a mixed integer linear programming model for solving thereby determining transaction prices and transaction electric quantities between the power distribution network operator and the plurality of microgrid operators and realizing optimal resource allocation in the power distribution network and theplurality of microgrids
