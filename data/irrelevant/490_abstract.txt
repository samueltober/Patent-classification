The embodiment of the invention discloses a wavelength locking method and device which are used for improving the wavelength locking accuracy of a highorder microring The method specifically comprises the following steps a wavelength locking device acquires an incident light signal the wavelength locking device loads an initial voltage value combination for the cascade filter according to alookup table and the wavelength of the target filter the lookup table is used for indicating the mapping relation between the filtering wavelength and the voltage value of the cascade filter and thecascade filter comprises at least two rings the wavelength locking device generates an intermediate variable combination according to a first coordinate transformation matrix and the initial voltagevalue combination the first coordinate transformation matrix is an N  Norder matrix the wavelength locking device selects a target intermediate variable from the intermediate variable combinationto perform iterative feedback according to a first preset step length and the first coordinate transformation matrix and records a power value of the cascade filter and when the power value is maximum the wavelength locking device filters the target filter from the incident light signal
