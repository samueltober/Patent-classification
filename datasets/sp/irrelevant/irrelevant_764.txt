 CNA The invention discloses a faulttolerant control method for an automobile active suspension system based on adaptive fusion design and the method comprises the steps  establishing a mathematic model of the automobile active suspension system under the condition of an uncertain actuator fault and representing the uncertain impact on the control input of the system from the actuator fault uncertainty in a mode of the mathematic model step  designing a faulttolerant controller based on the mathematical model of the active suspension under the fault designing a basic feedback controllerin combination with inversion control to ensure a closedloop system problem designing a fault compensation controller for each fault mode and designing a comprehensive controller capable of solvingall the fault modes based on a fusion algorithm and  checking the performance of the faulttolerant controller by adopting a Lyapunov function method The method mainly solves two key uncertain factors of an actuator fault mode and a fault type ensures that the automobile active suspension system achieves an expected control target under the condition of uncertain actuator faults and obtainsideal performance
