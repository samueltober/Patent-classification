 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device capable of reducing weight variationSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  includes an inner member that is composed of an outer ring  having a vehicle body attaching flange e on an outer periphery and having plural rows of outside raceway surfaces c and d on an inner periphery a hub ring  having a smalldiameter step portion a extending in an axial direction on an outer periphery and an inner ring  pressed in the smalldiameter step portion a of the hub ring  has an inside raceway surface c opposite to one of plural rows of outside raceway surfaces c and d in the hub ring  and has an inside raceway surface a opposite to the other of the plural rows of outside raceway surfaces c and d on the inner ring  and a plurality of ball rows  and  stored so as to roll between both raceway surfaces c and a of the outer ring  and the inner member and between both raceway surfaces d and c An outer peripheral surface o of a first area R from the vehicle body attaching flange e at least in the axial direction of the outer ring  to an outer side end portion is a machined surface and the outer peripheral surface o of the first area R on the outer ring  has a surface parallel with the axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
