A multilevel inverter topology is disclosed The power converter circuit converts DC power at its input to provide alternating current AC at its output The power converter circuit may have a controller operably connected to a plurality of series connections of switches The controller may control one or more of the plurality of series connections of the switch to convert the DC input to provide a multilevel AC voltage with DC displacement across the two terminals of the power converter circuit Then a plurality of series connections of switches can be used to convert the multilevel AC voltage with DC displacement in the first output with respect to at least one of a neutral potential a ground potential or a terminal of the power converter circuit The terminals provide singlephase AC voltage
