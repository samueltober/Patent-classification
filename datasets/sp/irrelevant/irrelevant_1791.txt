 CNA The invention relates to an inverted singlecylinder type cylindrical linear motor active suspension The inverted singlecylinder type cylindrical linear motor active suspension actuator comprises a cylindrical linear motor type actuator assembly an inverted singlecylinder type damper assembly and a spiral spring assembly The cylindrical linear motor type actuator assembly comprises a primary assembly with a through hole in a specific shape and a secondary assembly installed in association with the primary assembly the primary assembly comprises a winding iron core and a primary outer cylinder and the primary iron core is of a circular ring structure and the secondary assembly comprises permanent magnets and magnetic conducting rings the permanent magnets and the magnetic conducting rings are sequentially and alternately installed on the side face of a damper outer cylinder the magnetic pole direction of each permanent magnet is parallel to the central axis of a damper and the permanent magnets are arranged in the mode that polarities are opposite According to the inverted singlecylinder type cylindrical linear motor active suspension the mounting space is saved the structural complexity is reduced the control force is generated for active control and the suspension performance is improved and the FailSafe failure protection characteristic is realized the basic mechanical structure is reserved the suspension can still work normally after a motor fails and the operation stability and the running stability of a vehicle are improved
