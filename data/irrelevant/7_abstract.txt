An electrical DCtoAC power conversion apparatus is disclosed that is primarily intended for use with solar photovoltaic sources in electric utility gridinteractive applications The invention improves the conversion efficiency and lowers the cost of DCtoAC inverters The enabling technology is a novel inverter circuit topology where the bulk of the throughput power from DC source to AC utility is processed only once The inverter does not require an isolation transformer and can be connected directly to a  Vac utility grid The invention also allows the power converter to start into photovoltaic array having higher open circuit voltages The invention also uses active ripple current cancellation to substantially reduce the cost size and weight of the main filter inductors
