 CNA The invention discloses an active suspension preview control method based on camera sensor pavement recognition The method comprises the following steps acquiring front pavement preview informationthrough a camera sensor performing data processing on the front road surface preview information to obtain a front road surface unevenness value and determining a road surface unevenness grade according to an unevenness division criterion receiving a front road surface unevenness grade instruction and establishing an active suspension model based on front road surface preview information designing a multiperformance index constrained active suspension Hinfinity optimal controller and obtaining a weight value in the Hinfinity optimal controller by using a multiobjective constraint optimization algorithm so as to realize performance balance of various performance indexes of the suspension According to the method the camera sensor is used for obtaining the road surface preview information the Hinfinity optimal control is combined the time lag phenomenon in the active suspension damping parameter adjusting process is improved and multiperformance index balance control overthe active suspension is achieved
