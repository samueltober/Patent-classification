 CNB The invention discloses an antisaturation adaptive control method and a system of a nonlinear active suspension The method and system fully consider the nonlinearity of stiffness and damping in suspension control process establish the nonlinearity suspension model before and after suspension control solve the problem that the existing suspension design model is relatively simple and make the model more accurate And aiming at the actuator saturation problem existing in the actual vehicle The method of input error saturation amplification is adopted and a stable auxiliary system is introduced to realize the compensation of control saturation which not only ensures the consistency and boundedness of output error but also has good smoothness and easy to select parameter value so that the suspension system successfully achieves the goal of antisaturation Further the method and the adaptive backstepping control method proposed by the system of the invention effectively solvethe influence of parameter uncertainty on the suspension system and improve the ride comfort ride comfort and operation safety
