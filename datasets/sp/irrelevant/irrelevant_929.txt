 CNU The utility model discloses an AGV based on FMS flexible production and used for intelligent manufacturing Vehicle body contraction grooves are formed in the two sides of the bottom of the vehicle body A first driving mechanism is arranged in the contraction groove a lifting mechanism is arranged on the first driving mechanism a roller mechanism is arranged at one end far away from the driving device of the lifting mechanism the AGV for intelligent manufacturing based on FMS flexible production has the advantages that the structure is simple a roller mechanism at the bottom of the vehicle body can be contracted into a contraction groove through a first driving mechanism and a lifting mechanism therefore when the AGV is in a passive state the roller mechanism can be contracted into the vehicle body so that the bottom of the AGV is in contact with the ground the AGV can be prevented from sliding in the passive state the contact area between the AGV and the ground is increased and the passive stability of the AGV is improved
