The power converter  is a selfexcited power converter  that converts power between an AC circuit  and a DC circuit  and a switching element included in the selfexcited power converter  It is equipped with a control device  that controls the switching operation of a b The control device  calculates the deviation between the control command value for the selfexcited power converter  and the feedback value from the selfexcited power converter  and when the deviation exceeds the first threshold value First the first control for increasing the switching frequency of the switching elements a b is executed
