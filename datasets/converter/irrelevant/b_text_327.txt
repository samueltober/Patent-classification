 CNB The invention provides an ACDC hybrid microgrid modular structure and a multimode operation mode and belongs to the field of microgrid modular design and operation control An ACDC hybrid microgrid is divided into six modules and the type and the control mode of distributed power supplies or energy storage in each module are determined The six modules are a PCC module an AC microgrid regulation module an AC microgrid nonregulation module a DC microgrid regulation module a DC microgrid nonregulation module and an interconnection module Double guarantee is provided for the relatively weak DC microgrid in the gridconnected microgrid through the conversion operation among the DC microgrid automatic control mode in the gridconnected state the interconnection module control mode and the island mode in the offgrid state The controllable distributed power supplies energy storage and interconnected converters in different modules are combined to be controlled and the microgrid is accessed to a large power grid with a variable power load or power supply The dependency of MGCC on the communication system is reduced by using a twolayer control method including a module lay and a microgrid layer
