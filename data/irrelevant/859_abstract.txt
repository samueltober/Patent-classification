PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To improve living cost    SOLUTION A water wheelshaped object is installed and if the sea wave is a rias type coast the tsunami will rush to a high place so such a structure is artificially created and the seawater is pushed to a place  meters or more higher than the coastline Bring it with Then by accumulating it this time it is used as a power source for turning a hydroelectric turbine that uses gravity to generate electricity or for turning a compressor such as air It is useful for human life by obtaining a large amount of potential energy of seawater semipermanently by using the energy of sea waves
