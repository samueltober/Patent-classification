 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of automobiles The utility model discloses an Hshaped beam of an automobile front axle The automobile front axle Ishaped beam solves the problems that in the using process of a common automobile front axle Ishaped beam the two ends of the common automobile front axle Ishaped beam and an external connecting piece are prone to deviating due toabrasion due to frequent rotation and the middle of the common automobile front axle Ishaped beam is prone to relative sliding According to the Ishaped beam the bearings the stripshaped clamping blocks and the stripshaped clamping grooves are used in cooperation and after the bearings the stripshaped clamping blocks and the stripshaped clamping grooves are used in cooperation the service life of the Ishaped beam can be further prolonged through cooperative use of the mounting holes and the antiskid lines the external connecting piece can be mounted through the mounting holesand due to the fact that the antiskid lines are formed in the top of the plate spring mounting part friction force can be increased and the relative sliding phenomenon of the plate spring mountingpart is avoided
