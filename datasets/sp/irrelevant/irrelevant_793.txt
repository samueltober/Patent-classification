 CNU The utility model provides a Macpherson suspension capable of increasing the inclination angle towing distance of a main pin which comprises an auxiliary frame and two steering knuckles symmetricallyarranged at the two ends of the auxiliary frame and each steering knuckle is connected with the auxiliary frame through two connecting rods to realize the upanddown jumping andor steering motionof a wheel The connecting structure has the beneficial effects that  two connecting rods are adopted to replace a traditional lower ball pin to enable the auxiliary frame and the steering knuckleto be connected with each other thinking and technical limitations are broken through and a brandnew technical scheme capable of achieving upanddown jumping andor steering movement of the wheelsis provided  an included angle is formed between the first connecting rod and the second connecting rod so that extension lines of axes of the first connecting rod and the second connecting rodcan intersect the connection line between the intersection point of the main line axis and the center point of the upper top rubber is the main pin axis the towing distance between the main line axis and the wheel is larger than the towing distance between a traditional main pin axis and the wheel and therefore better braking stability and lowspeed automatic aligning performance are achieved
