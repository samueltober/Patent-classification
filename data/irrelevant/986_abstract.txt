This application discloses a protection control method device terminal and medium for a multiterminal direct current transmission system The method provided in this application adds the return of the converter station generated when any converter station in the multiterminal direct current transmission system performs the exit action Station signal by monitoring the converter station exit signal output the first level signal according to the monitored signal state and then through the logic gate circuit perform logic gate operation on the initial protection control signal and the first level signal to make the commutation When the station monitors the converter station exit signal it does not trigger the DC line restart action avoids the DC voltage mutation protection misoperation and solves the problem that the existing multiterminal DC transmission system is prone to DC when the converter station exits The technical problem of voltage mutation protection malfunction
