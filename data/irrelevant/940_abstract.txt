An apparatus and method of power transmission the apparatus of power transmission implemented at a transmitting station comprises a first converter  configured to convert a first threephase AC component of a first frequency into a second threephase AC component of a second frequency the second frequency being less than the first frequency and greater than a predetermined frequency and a first controller  coupled to the first converter  and configured to cause the second threephase AC component to be transmitted in an AC transmission line  The apparatus of power transmission implemented at a receiving station comprises a second controller  configured to cause the second threephase AC component to be received from the AC transmission line  and a second converter  coupled to the second controller  and configured to convert the second threephase AC component into the first threephase AC component In this way the limitation from the space charge accumulation of cable system can be eliminated and an improvement of the power transmission capacity can be facilitated
