 CNA The invention discloses a receiving end cascade hybrid direct current coordination control method based on dynamic amplitude limiting The method comprises the following steps of determining an overall UI characteristic curve of a receiving end cascade hybrid direct current power transmission system when an MMC employs a masterslave control mode and arranging a dynamic amplitude limiting link ina fixedpower flexible converter station of receiving end cascade hybrid direct current power transmission According to the method when the receiving end system fails the reactive power support potential of the flexible direct current to the alternating current system can be released to enhance the voltage stability of the alternating current system and on the other hand the active power output of the fixed power station can be automatically limited the arrangement inversion mode change of the fixed direct current voltage flexible converter station is avoided and the system stability is improved from two aspects of active frequency and reactive voltage
