 CNA The invention discloses a lightweight hub bearing unit and a treatment method for pretreating laser additive A bearing inner ring and the like are mainly included the bearing inner ring is installed at one end of a flange plate an outer side raceway is arranged at the root of a journal of the flange plate and the outer side raceway and an inner side raceway of the bearing inner ring form double rows of raceways of the hub bearing unit A bearing rolling body is installed between the double rows of raceways and kept fixed by a retainer a bearing outer ring is installed on the outer side of the bearing rolling body and sealing structures are arranged between the bearing outer ring and the bearing inner ring and between the bearing outer ring and the flange plate According to the lightweight hub bearing unit and the treatment method the lightweight purpose of the hub bearing unit is achieved by taking a lightweight aluminum alloy material as a base body material after a base body with the strength requirement is locally pretreated iron powder and other reinforcing materials are cladded to the corresponding positions through the laser additive manufacturing technology andthe using strength requirement of the hub bearing unit is guaranteed while light weight is achieved and meanwhile the additional characteristics of corrosion resistance wear resistance heat resistance and the like are obtained through regulation and control by different cladding materials
