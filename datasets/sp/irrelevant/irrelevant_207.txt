 CNB The invention relates to a vehicle safety protection method device and system The method comprises the following steps of acquiring relative lateral motion parameters of an adjacent vehicle on theside of the vehicle wherein the relative lateral motion parameter comprises a relative lateral velocity and a relative lateral distance estimating a lateral intrusion level of a side collision eventaccording to the relative lateral motion parameter wherein the lateral intrusion level is positively correlated with the probability of a side collision event when the estimated lateral intrusion level is greater than a preset first level the control suspension system lifts the vehicle body to a preset height so that the adjacent vehicle is in touch with the sill beam of the vehicle By adopting the scheme the damage degree of the vehicle on the side of the vehicle can be reduced and the protection strength of the vehicle passenger can be improved
