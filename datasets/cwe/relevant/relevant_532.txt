 JPA To realize a structure which can unfailingly prevent occurrence of electric corrosion on an outer ring raceway an inner ring raceway and a rolling surface of rolling elements and secure good concentricity between a rotary flange and a motor caseSOLUTION A case  is fitted on an outer peripheral surface of a rotary flange  processed coaxially with an inner ring raceway b at the axial outer side without causing rattling and a first O ring  is disposed at the inner side of a step part  of the rotary flange  and placed in elastic contact with an outer peripheral surface of an axial intermediate part of a shaft part  of a stud  and an axial inner surface of an inward facing flange part  of the case  A second O ring  is disposed at the inner side of a recessed groove  of the rotary flange  and elastically sandwiched between a bottom surface of the recessed groove  and the axial inner surface of the inward facing flange part  of the case SELECTED DRAWING Figure
