 CNU The utility model relates to an auxiliary frame and a connecting structure of the auxiliary frame and a stabilizer bar According to the connecting structure of the auxiliary frame and the stabilizerbar due to the first cavity formed between the first longitudinal beam and the first cross beam the second cavity formed between the second longitudinal beam and the first longitudinal beam and thetwo cavity structures the vertical rigidity of the auxiliary frame is enhanced and the bearing capacity of the auxiliary frame is enhanced and meanwhile the first connecting piece is arranged in the first cavity the bottom of the first connecting piece is connected with the first longitudinal beam and the first connecting piece increases the vertical rigidity of the stabilizer bar mounting point so that the auxiliary frame is not prone to cracking
