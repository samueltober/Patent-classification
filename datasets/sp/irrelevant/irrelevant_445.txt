 EPB A roll vibration damping control system  includes an electronic control unit  configured to compute a sum of a product of a roll moment of inertia Ix and a roll angular acceleration s of a vehicle body  a product of a roll damping coefficient Cx and a firstorder integral s of the roll angular acceleration and a product of an equivalent roll stiffness Kx of the vehicle and a secondorder integral  of the roll angular acceleration as a controlled roll moment Mxc to be applied to the vehicle body compute a roll moment around a center of gravity of a sprung mass as a correction roll moment Mxa the roll moment being generated by lateral force on wheels due to roll motion and compute a target roll moment Mxt based on a value obtained by correcting the controlled roll moment with the correction roll moment
