 CNB The invention discloses a highspeed train antivibration and noise reduction structure which comprises a transmission shaft and a noise reduction mechanism wheels are connected to the outer sides of the two ends of the transmission shaft correspondingly a first antivibration mechanism is arranged in the middle of the transmission shaft second antivibration mechanisms are arranged at the twoends of the transmission shaft the first antivibration mechanism is composed of a fixing seat a first mounting seat a first supporting rod and a first return spring and fixing grooves are formedin the two ends of the top of the fixing seat correspondingly According to the highspeed train antivibration and noise reduction structure the gas flow in a gas supply pipeline is controlled through a flow controller gas is ejected on the suction side of a cavity of a train by an ejector thus a cutting layer on the upper part of the cavity is affected collision between the cutting layer and the back wall of the cavity is reduced thus the aerodynamic noise in the cavity is decreased and the purpose of noise reduction is achieved
