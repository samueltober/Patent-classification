 CNU The utility model discloses a doublerearwheel transmission system which comprises a fuel engine and rotating shafts are fixedly connected to the front side and the rear side of the fuel engine Through cooperative use of the damping spring the fuel oil engine the chain body the first driven wheel the synchronous belt and the second driven wheel through use of the fuel oil engine the chainbody can drive the first driven wheel to rotate and the first driven wheel enables the first driven wheel and the second driven wheel to move synchronously under the action of the synchronous beltaccording to the doublerearwheel transmission the situation that the doublerearwheel transmission inclines forwards and inclines backwards under the emergency braking situation is guaranteed comfort and damping performance in the driving process are improved through the damping springs and the problem that in the using process of an existing doublerearwheel transmission due to the fact that the damping performance and comfort are poor bumping is prone to being too large in the driving process is solved the doublerearwheel transmission system has the advantages of being good in comfort and high in safety and is worthy of popularization
