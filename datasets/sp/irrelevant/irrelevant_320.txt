 CNB An independent suspension guiding mechanism for an extraheavy chassis comprises an upper cross arm assembly and a lower cross arm assembly The inner side of the upper cross arm assembly and the inner side of the lower cross arm assembly are both connected with a vehicle frame through pin shafts and the upper cross arm assembly and the lower cross arm assembly can swing around the pin shafts ina YZ plane the outer side of the upper cross arm assembly and the outer side of the lower cross arm assembly are correspondingly connected with an upper interface and a lower interface of a wheel setsteering knuckle through spherical hinges and the spherical hinges provide freedom degrees for wheels to jump up and down and swing left and right a notch which is as deep as possible is formed outwards in the inner side of the lower cross arm assembly on the premise of meeting structural strength the YZ plane is a coordinate plane defined under a vehicle coordinate system
