The invention discloses a panshearing method based on shear wave transformation The panshearing method comprises the following steps of obtaining a panshearing matrix according to the method obtaining a multispectral image HRMS with high spatial resolution by combining spatial spectrum information of a panchromatic image PAN with high spatial resolution and a multispectral image MS withlow spatial resolution The core of the method is twostep shear wave domain image fusion The fusion process is carried out in two steps and each step is carried out in a shear wave domain According to the method on the basis of a traditional pansharing method the spatial structure information of the PAN image and the spectral information of the MS image are utilized the spectral and spatialrelationship between the highresolution PAN image the lowresolution PAN image and the MS image is fully mined and a fused image with spectral fidelity and rich spatial details is obtained throughorganic fusion of the information
