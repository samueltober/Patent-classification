 CNA     The invention provides an active suspension control method a device and an automobile for predicting acceleration and relates to the technical field of automobiles The active suspension control method for predicting acceleration includes acquiring the target acceleration of the vehicle calculated by the adaptive cruise system of the vehicle sending a control signal to the suspension system when the target acceleration is greater than a first preset value  The control signal is used to control the damping force of the suspension system The above scheme predicts the target acceleration of the vehicle through the adaptive cruise system and activates the active suspension control when the target acceleration meets certain conditions ensuring that the vehicle reaches the optimal control state during the acceleration process and reduces the vehicle pitch rate to The lowest which improves the driving comfort and handling stability of the vehicle
