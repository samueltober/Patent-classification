 JPA To provide an inexpensive vehicular drive wheel support device which facilitates pressurization controlling can prevent the invasion of muddy water or the like and has a structure of preventing noise when startedSOLUTION When a hub  and an inside inner ring  are adhered a dedicated coupling ring  applies optimal pressurization to perform screw fastening The coupling ring  has a groove on an end surface opposite from an end surface brought into contact with the inside inner ring  spline or serration processing is applied to an inner diameter side of the groove and a plurality of notches penetrating from an outer diameter side to a groove inner diameter part are provided When the coupling ring  and the spline or the serration of a driving side constant velocity joint outer ring  undergo fitting in a minus gap the coupling ring  is elastically deformed on an outer diameter side to easily undergo fitting by the effect of the plurality of notches performed in the coupling ring  a constant velocity joint  and the hub  can be connected in a rotation direction without any gap so as to eliminate the occurrence of noise A comeoff preventive spring  can be used as a jig during assembling and disassembling Also a waterproof cover  performs waterproofing of a connection partSELECTED DRAWING Figure
