 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of multichannel receivers of synthetic aperture radar systems and discloses a method and a device for designing a multichannel receiver of a doublebasesatelliteborne SAR system According to the method and the device for designing a multichannel receiver of a doublebase satelliteborne SAR system eight receiving channels are included and a V power supply and a serial control signal are provided for each radio frequency receiving channel through a power supply conversion unit and a control distribution unit in a unified mode Each radiofrequency receiving channel can independently complete the functions of low noise amplification MGC intermediate frequency amplification balanced phase shift compensation output and the like of radar echo signals every two receiving channels are output through cross backup and imaging indexes of a whole radar system are influenced by amplitudephase consistency performance indexes of every two receiving channels The method and the device for designing a multichannel receiver of a doublebase satelliteborne SAR system have the outstanding advantages that  the multichannel receiveris adopted to better meet the working requirements of a new system of highresolution and wideswath satelliteborne SAR and  the amplitudes and the phases of the receiving channels are compensatedthrough an equalization phase shifter and a microstrip power division power combiner the amplitude consistency among the channels reaches  dB and the phase consistency reaches  degrees
