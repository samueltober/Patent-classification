 CNA The invention relates to a straight beam structure axle with a hollow and separated groove shell The structure axle is characterized in that an axle supporting cross beam is in a hollow and separatedtype that is a cross beam in the middle of the axle is opened towards two sides a certain space is reserved in the middle of the axle for arranging a motor a speed changing mechanism a speed reducing mechanism and a differential mechanism the axle middle cross beam is of a Ushaped groove shell structure and is a straight beam integrated with bowl openings at two ends section heights of groove shells are the same and the axle middle cross beam is a straight beam The axle is advantaged in that the motor the speed reducer and a differential mechanism which are integrated on an electric drive axle are integrated and fixed to a spring and the unsprung mass is reduced the height of the motor is increased the severe working environment is reduced and the motor is not easy to demagnetize and if a transmission structure is adopted sprung gear shifting is smoother than unsprung gear shifting
