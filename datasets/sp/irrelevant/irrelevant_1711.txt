 CNA The invention relates to an air spring and a multiconnectingrod independent suspension The air spring comprises an upper cover an airbag arranged below the upper cover and the top end of the airbag being connected with the upper cover through a first snap ring a first restraint ring arranged on the inner wall of the airbag and dividing the airbag into two sections at least two layers of smooth cord threads being adopted for the exposed part of the uppersection airbag and crossed cord threads being adopted for the other parts of the airbag a piston arranged below the airbag and forms a sealed container with the upper cover and the airbag and the outer edge of the top end of the piston being connected with the airbag through a second snap ring a base arranged below the piston and the upper end being connected with the piston a bearing arranged between the base and the piston and connected with the upper end of the base and a restraining cover arranged on the outer wall of the lowersection air bag and connected with the first restraining ring and the lowersection air bag into a whole The air spring solves the problem that a traditional air spring cannot achieve torsion and deflection and is small in installation space low in cost and long in service life
