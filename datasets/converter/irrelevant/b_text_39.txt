 USB A multiphase converter includes a plurality of phase paths Each phase path includes at least one dclink that is independent from every other phase path dclink such that each output phase voltage is generated from a corresponding dclink voltage source that can be different from every other phase voltage dclink voltage source A total dclink voltage level is determined for each output phase voltage A commonmode injection voltage is calculated based on all dclink voltage levels and all phase reference voltages Each phase path reference voltage is then adjusted based on the calculated commonmode injection voltage such that each generated output phase voltage level is adjusted in response to its corresponding adjusted reference voltage
