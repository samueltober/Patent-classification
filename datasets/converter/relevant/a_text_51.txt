 CNA The embodiment of the invention relates to a multilevel converter optimization control method and device based on minimum reflux power and the method comprises the steps obtaining an input internalphase shift angle an output internal phase shift angle and an output external phase shift angle of a multilevel converter under the minimum reflux power through solving and carrying out the controloperation of the multilevel converter the defects of large reflux power low efficiency and the like caused by mismatching of input and output voltages during phase shift control of the multilevel converter can be overcome the reflux power of the converter can be effectively reduced in a full power range and a full transformation ratio range and the efficiency and the performance of the whole converter are improved the technical problems that the system loss is increased and the efficiency is reduced due to the fact that an existing threelevel DAB converter generates large reflux power byadopting a traditional phase shift control mode under the voltage mismatching operation working condition are solved
