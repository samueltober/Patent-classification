 JPA To provide a driving wheel bearing device which can be made lightweight and compact and in which generation of abnormal noise at a contact surface between the caulked part of a hub wheel and the shoulder of the outer ring of a joint can be prevented for a long timeSOLUTION The driving wheel bearing device comprises an outer member  an inner member comprised of a hub wheel and an inner ring  which is formed with an inner raceway surface a and is pressfitted into a caulked part c at an end of the hub wheel  double row rolling elements  a joint outer ring  fitted to the hub wheel  in a torque transmittable manner and attachablydetachably fastened to the hub wheel  and an annular plateshaped thrust bearing  interposed between the shoulder part c of the joint outer ring  and the caulked part c of the hub wheel  the thrust bearing  has on the thrust surface a sliding layer formed directly on a metal substrate or via a metal porous layer the sliding layer has a fluororesin layer including a fluororesin on the surface the fluororesin layer is a crosslinked fluororesin layer in which at least a region near the surface is crosslinked the average crosslink rate from the outermost surface to a depth of  m is  to SELECTED DRAWING Figure
