 JPA To provide an inwheel motor drive device which enables a wheel speed detection part including a pulser ring and a rotation sensor to be arranged without affecting a length of the inwheel motor drive device as seen in an axle direction and enables a gap between a detected part of the pulser ring and the rotation sensor to be accurately checkedSOLUTION A wheel speed detection part  of an inwheel motor drive device  includes a pulser ring  having a detected part  disposed within a hat part  of a brake rotor BD and attached coaxially with a rotary ring  of a wheel hub bearing part  and a rotation sensor  which is attached to a fixed portion  so as to face the detected part  of the pulser ring SELECTED DRAWING Figure
