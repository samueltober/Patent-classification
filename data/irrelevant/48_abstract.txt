A DC to AC converter is configured to convert DC power from a floating DC power source to AC power having a desired voltage and waveform A plurality of capacitors is charged to discrete voltages from the DC power A switching network selectively connects the capacitors in series to an AC output node For selected capacitors either the associated voltage or the inverse of the associated voltage is summed together nonselected capacitors contribute zero volts to the sum The sum voltage is output to the AC output node at two values and the voltage is jittered between these two values at a high frequency in order to approximate intermediate values The two values jittered between and the values and timing of the intermediate values are controlled to construct a desired waveform such as an approximation to a sine wave
