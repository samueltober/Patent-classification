 WOA The invention relates to a vehicle axle having a wheelguiding link which is provided to support transverse forces or lateral forces is mounted elastically on the vehicle body either directly at a bearing point or indirectly via an axle support and is formed by at least two cylindrical elastomer bearings which are connected functionally in parallel and which are arranged side by side with coincident cylinder axes The link can be designed in the manner of a bar link which branches in its half facing the vehicle body into two or more arms arranged side by side alternatively the link is a triangular transverse link which at the bearing point associated with one transverse link portion of the triangular transverse link has two or more receiving points arranged side by side for elastomer bearings The transverse rigidities of the plurality of elastomer bearings connected functionally in parallel are preferably the same and correspond in sum to the transverse rigidity of a usually single elastomer bearing provided at said bearing point
