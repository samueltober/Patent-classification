 CNA The invention discloses a vehicle ISD semiactive suspension PID time lag switching compensation control method based on a stability switching theory According to the method on the basis of a traditional PID controller the influence of response time lag of an actuator on suspension performance is eliminated through the means that damping switching is matched with time lag compensation On the basis of a stability switching theory a principle basis of controller design is obtained by establishing a kinetic equation containing a timedelay suspension solving a system characteristic equation obtaining a system stability discrimination polynomial deriving a fulltimedelay stable condition and a minimum critical timedelay point in a nonfulltimedelay stable state and a control strategy is designed by combining a switch switching principle and a timedelay compensation principle on the basis of the principle basis The invention provides a novel control method for overcoming adverse factors of time lag compared with traditional PID control the comprehensive performance of the ISD suspension can be improved under the same time lag effect and the antitimelag effect is obvious
