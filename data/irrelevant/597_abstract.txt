The invention relates to an aircraft carrier destroying guided missile The whole guided missile is divided into multiple layers in length five gunpowder layers and four impact discs A gunpowder layer cover is arranged at the bottom of each impact layer and eight headless guided missiles are mounted on an iron disc in an iron disc box By launching the aircraft carrier destroying guided missilein the sky the eight headless guided missiles on the iron disc knocks down on the bottom of the iron disc fuses of the headless guided missiles are ignited and the gunpowder layers break out and the impact discs are impacted by means of explosive power to lead to explosive power of the five gunpowder layers and impact forces of the four impact discs By launching the aircraft carrier destroying guided missile in the sky velocity potential is converted into power multiple gunpowder explosive power and multiple impact forces of the impact discs and integral weight impact force The multiple forces are combined to form hundreds of force that is centralized to an impact tooth head to destroy a deck of an aircraft carrier and a nuclear bomb is sent to a cabin of the aircraft carrier by means of massive gunpowder explosive power of a bottom gunpowder barrel so that everything in the aircraft carrier is destroyed thoroughly or the aircraft carrier sinks into the sea
