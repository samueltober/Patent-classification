A multilevel switching power converter includes a string of N upper transistors and a string of N lower transistors where N is an integer greater than one The N upper transistors are electrically coupled in series between a first power node and a switching node and the N lower transistors are electrically coupled in series between the switching node and a reference node The multilevel switching power converter further includes N flying capacitors an inductor a bypass transistor and a controller The bypass transistor is electrically coupled between the switching node and the reference node The controller is configured to a control switching of the N upper transistors and the N lower transistors and b cause the bypass transistor to operate in its on state in response to all of the N lower transistors operating in their respective on states
