 WOA The present disclosure relates to a display module display screen and display screen power supply backup method The method comprises obtaining output state parameters of a power supply module detecting whether the output state parameters match preset state parameters when the output status parameters do not match the preset status parameters sending an interrupt signal to the power supply module sending a power adjustment signal to the display unit corresponding to the power supply module After a fault occurs only stop the output of the faulty power supply module and by means of the adjacent power supply supply power to the display unit corresponding to the faulty power supply module by sending a power adjustment signal to the display unit corresponding to the failed power supply module the input required by the display unit is reduced to a preset input power so that the adjacent power supply module ensures that while ensuring the normal power supply of the corresponding display unit thereof the display unit corresponding to the faulty power supply module continues to display which prevents the display unit corresponding to the failed power supply module from not displaying and reduces the probability of the display unit having a black screen
