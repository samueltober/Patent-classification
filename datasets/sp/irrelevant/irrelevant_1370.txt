 CNU The utility model discloses a rear overhang structure of a passenger car frame The device comprises a transverse connecting rod a connecting rod a longitudinal thrust rod an elastic element a shock absorber and a bracket simple structure later maintenance of the passenger car is facilitated a telescopic rod is arranged in the transverse connecting rod the purpose of adjusting the length is achieved transverse force borne by wheels of the passenger car can be buffered therefore the service life of the transverse connecting rod is prolonged the elastic element and the shock absorberare provided with softer rigid spring devices at the same time the elastic performance of the passenger car rear overhang structure is better improving comfort of an automobile therefore the driving stability of the automobile is improved and the oil storage cylinder pipe is installed in the shock absorber when the rear wheel is impacted by a convex road surface the cylinder barrel moves upwards and the piston relatively moves downwards in the inner cylinder barrel so that the wheel vibrates when being suddenly impacted and the impact load of the concaveconvex road surface on a vehicle is effectively attenuated
