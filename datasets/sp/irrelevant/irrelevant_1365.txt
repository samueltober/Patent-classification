 CNU The utility model relates to a small damping mechanism for a mobile platform The small damping mechanism is installed between a mobile chassis and a mobile mechanism Wherein the bearing cross beam is used for being fixed to a moving chassis the spring upper cover is fixed to the bottom face of the bearing cross beam and the spring lower cover is fixed to the top side of a moving mechanism Thespring upper cover and the spring lower cover are assembled in a sleeved mode and used for enabling the spring upper cover and the spring lower cover to only move up and down relatively An inner cavity of the spring upper cover and an inner cavity of the spring lower cover jointly form a damping spring containing space a damping spring is arranged in the damping spring containing space one endof the damping spring abuts against the top face of the inner side of the spring upper cover the other end of the damping spring is pressed on the bottom face of the inner side of the spring lower cover and the damping spring is used for providing damping for the moving chassis and the moving mechanism The small damping mechanism for the mobile platform is simple in structure modular in production and assembly and suitable for mobile chassis of different specifications and the optimal damping effect is achieved
