 CNA     The invention discloses an automobile wheel hub mandrel and a manufacturing method thereof The mandrel body is made to avoid surrounding environmental parts during the assembly process through the base the fixed disc and the base are integrally formed and the fixed protrusion is assembled On the wheel hub bearing the fixed disc and the fixed protrusion strengthen the structural strength of the mandrel and a rotary forging machine is used to temper the mandrel blank made of alloy structural steel which improves the hardenability and thermal strength of the mandrel and combines the material characteristics Heat treatment of the mandrel to avoid and eliminate the internal stress generated by the material during processing After processing the surface of the mandrel it is electroplated with antirust oil to control friction prevent the inner ring from jamming and damage enhance the strength of the mandrel and reduce the assembly of the mandrel In the case of a middle fracture the safety of the whole vehicle is improved
