 CNU The utility model provides a motorcycle front wheel driving shaft which relates to the technical field of machinery and comprises a connecting disc a bearing matching table is arranged at one end ofthe left side of the connecting disc and fixedly connected with the left side of the connecting disc and a first cylindrical table is arranged at one end of the right side of the connecting disc Afirst spline body is arranged at one end of the left side of the oil sealing matching table a second spline body is symmetrically arranged on the first spline body with the connecting disc as the center the driving shaft has the advantages of being convenient to install and good in transmission performance and stability the surfaces of the first spline body and the second spline body are covered with a protection layer and the protection layer is a copperplated protection layer when the parts move the object conditions between the parts are not met so that abrasion is caused between the parts through the copperplated protection layer the situation that the physical conditions between the parts cannot achieve the met effect is effectively avoided later maintenance of the drivingshaft of the driving shaft is reduced and the expenditure cost is effectively reduced
