 KRB The present invention relates to a jig for assembling a constant velocity joint comprising an outer race with a ball dent formed on the inner circumference a tubular inner race with a ball dent formed on the outer circumference a tubular cage with a cage hole formed on a side and a ball bearing accommodated between the ball dent and a ball groove The jig for assembling a constant velocity joint includes a base plate a post coupled and fixed to the upper surface of the base plate and having a joint groove formed in the center of the upper end a separation prevention device coupled to and fixed to the upper part of the post and having a joint hole corresponding to the joint groove in the center of the upper end a ball joint comprising a spherical rotating body inserted and received in the joint groove and the joint hole and a rodshaped support member coupled to the upper part of the rotating body a spring supported by the base plate while surrounding the outside of the post a pressure guide body that is formed in a cylindrical shape with an inclined rim in one direction is mounted while being elastically supported on the upper end of the spring and allows the separation prevention hole and the ball joint to pass therethrough and a jig coupled to the support member rotating back and forth left and right within a certain angular range and having a first stage and a second stage having a stepped shape so that the inner race and the lower end of the cage can be seated Accordingly the inner race and the cage are seated on the jig the ball bearing is inserted into the cage hole and then the outer race rotates along the upper end of the pressure guide body thereby assembling the constant velocity joint
