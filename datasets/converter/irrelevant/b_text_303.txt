 CNB The invention discloses a bypass control method for a fault power module of a modular multilevel converter The bypass control method comprises the following steps that  enabling the fault power module of the modular multilevel converter to execute an instruction for triggering a bypass operation  judging whether a current value Iarm of a bridge arm of the modular multilevel converter where the fault power module is located exceeds a current protection fixed value IarmMAX of the bridge arm or not if yes executing the step  or executing the step   executing all power module instructions of the bridge arm of the modular multilevel converter where the temporary blocking fault power module is located  judging whether the fault power module completes an instruction of bypass operation or not if yes determining that the bypass control of the fault power module is successful According to the method the requirements of the bypass function of the power module on the capacitance capacity in the power module and the switchingon speed of a bypass mechanical switch can be effectively reduced the size and the cost of the modular multilevel converter are reduced and the reliability is improved
