 CNB The invention discloses an electric wheel system with a hub motor simultaneously serving as dynamic vibration absorber mass The electric wheel system with the hub motor simultaneously serving as thedynamic vibration absorber mass comprises the hub motor wheels a brake mechanism a control mechanism a speed reduction mechanism and an electromagnetic damper wherein the hub motor simultaneouslyserving as the dynamic vibration absorber mass and the electromagnetic damper form the dynamic vibration absorber According to the electric wheel system with the hub motor simultaneously serving asthe dynamic vibration absorber mass the dynamic vibration absorber not only can generate an active electromagnetic excitation force but also can generate a passive electromagnetic damping force thetwo resistances can collectively inhibit vertical vibration in addition the hub motor is converted into the sprung mass the unsprung mass is reduced and therefore the smoothness and the grounding safety of the vehicle are improved
