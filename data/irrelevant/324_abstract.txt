A power converter having a ScottT transformer includes a direct current to alternating current converter configured to have at least two multilevel converters converting input direct current power to alternating current power a ScottT transformer configured to operate in medium frequency of several hundreds of Hz to several tens of kHz to transform a voltage level of the alternating current power from each of the at least two multilevel converters of the direct current to alternating current converter into threephase alternating current power and to output the threephase alternating current power and an alternating current to direct current converter configured to convert the threephase alternating current power from the ScottT transformer to direct current power
