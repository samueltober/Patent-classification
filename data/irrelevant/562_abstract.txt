The invention discloses an STMbased multifunctional intelligent control system for a pure electric watering cart The STMbased multifunctional intelligent control system for the pure electric watering cart comprises two working modes The first working mode is a water pumping mode after the water pumping mode is started an STM singlechip microcomputer broadcasts the required time for full pumping through a loudspeaker box according to the water level information in a water tank and automatically controls a motor to be turned off when the pressure of the water pump is too high or the water level of the water tank does not change within  seconds or the water level in the water tank reaches a threshold value due to blockage of the water pipe the second working mode is a watering mode after the watering mode is started the STM singlechip microcomputer adjusts a water spraying strategy according to the road condition and when a water pressure sensor module and a water level sensor module detect that the water pressure of the water pump is too high or the water tank is out of water the STM singlechip microcomputer chip control module automatically turns off a water pump motor and the loudspeaker module carries out voice broadcasting to remind the driver of taking corresponding measures The intelligent control system is high in intelligent degree and convenient to use
