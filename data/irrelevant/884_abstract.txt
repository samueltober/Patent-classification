The invention discloses a control method device storage medium and electronic equipment of an AC and DC power distribution system Wherein the method includes when a singlephase ground fault occurs in the AC distribution network in the AC and DC distribution system determining the negative sequence current in the AC distribution network Sequential current is suppressed Among them the DC distribution network adopts a doubleended topology structure The first converter and the second converter in the doubleended topology structure are both modular multilevel converters and the first converter Use constant power control and the second converter uses constant DC voltage control The invention solves the problem that the asymmetrical fault of the AC system in the prior art has an impact on the DC distribution network and cannot guarantee that the DC distribution network still maintains highefficiency power generation of distributed power sources and highquality power supply to DC loads when the AC system fails technical problem
