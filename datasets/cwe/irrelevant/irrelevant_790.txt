 CNU     The utility model discloses a throughbridge output shaft assembly which belongs to the technical field of automobiles The throughbridge output shaft assembly of the utility model includes a through shaft an oil seal seat a bearing and a locking member The through shaft is inserted in the axle housing the oil seal seat is sleeved with an oil seal and the oil seal is sleeved on the through shaft the oil seal The seat and the axle housing are detachably connected the bearing is sleeved on the through shaft one end of the bearing is sleeved in the oil seal seat and the other end is sleeved in the axle housing so that the oil seal and the bearing are coaxially arranged the locking piece can connect the bearing and Through shaft lock By adopting the oil seal seat instead of the original adjusting ring structure and using the outer diameter of the bearing to center the oil seal seat and the axle housing radially the coaxiality of the bearing and the oil seal is improved compared with the adjusting ring structure and the coaxiality is solved The large deviation leads to the problem of oil leakage in the oil seal which in turn improves the reliability of the seal
