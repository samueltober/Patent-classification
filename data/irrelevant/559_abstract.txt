According to the dredger pipeline conveying passive yield meter Cs and Co nuclear isotopes are not designed the psychological fear of crew worrying about nuclear radiation is overcome and theproblem of radioactive source processing after remote construction reporting and scrapping is solved a passive sensor based on an electrical tomography method is adopted so that the accuracy of theconveying concentration and flow measurement precision of the liquidsolid twophase fluid pipeline is improved the polarization influence on the surface of the electrode can be eliminated in a powerfrequency alternatingcurrent excitation mode because the power frequency alternating current signal is a continuous signal the established magnetic field is a continuous alternating magnetic field the sampling speed is high and the acquisition result is only related to the flow the electromagnetic flowmeter is suitable for construction sites with different medium conditions and the excitation frequency of the electromagnetic flowmeter does not need to be adjusted the output electromotive force of the electrode is measured in a power frequency alternating current excitation mode amplification and conversion are very easy and processing is easier than direct current signals
