 CNB The present invention discloses an optical fiber remote centralized timing system and method based on BD and GPS The system comprises at least one satellite antenna an active timing host and at least one active timing distribution unit The satellite antenna is connected with the active timing host The optical fiber remote centralized timing system based on BD and GPS is composed of a BDGPS antenna  primary and secondary units and the distribution unit so as to improve accuracy and safety of base station timing A photoelectric hybrid cable is adopted for transmission which can transmit at least one kilometer An optical fiber can be stretched to  kilometers if a manner of taking nearest electricity is adopted thereby fundamentally solving the problem of affecting a base station location due to the limited transmission distance
