 CNA The invention provides an AGV chassis which comprises a bottom plate a front frame a rear frame two driving wheel assemblies an adjusting mechanism a first side arm and a second side arm the first side arm and the second side arm are rotatably arranged on the bottom plate and the front frame and the driving wheel assemblies form a first lever structure through the first side arm The rear frame and the driving wheel assembly form a second lever structure through a second side arm and the adjusting mechanism is arranged between the bottom plate and the driving wheel assembly when the first lever structure and the second lever structure swing the driving wheel assembly enables the midpoint of the connecting line between the driving wheels of the two driving wheel assemblies to coincide with the center of the bottom plate through the adjusting mechanism Compared with the prior art the AGV chassis has the advantages that the midpoint of the connecting line between the driving wheels of the two driving wheel assemblies coincides with the center of the bottom plate through the adjusting mechanism it is guaranteed that the rotating center of the vehicle body cannot be changedalong with fluctuation or inclination of the road surface accordingly the control precision of the vehicle body is improved and position errors caused by excessive deviation of an AGV are effectively prevented
