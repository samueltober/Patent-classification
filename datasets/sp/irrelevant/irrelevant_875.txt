 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of rollers and discloses a Mecanum mother wheel with good obstacle crossing ability which comprises a shell sleeves are fixedly connected to the front and rear side walls in the shell and protective shells are fixedly connected to the opposite sides of the two sleeves The utility model discloses a Mecanum mother wheel with good obstacle crossing ability The rotating motor is electrified to drive the transmission shaft to rotate the rotating shaft rotates under the combined action of the belt the belt pulley and the transmission shaft therefore the driving wheel rotates according to the device through the sleeve and the protective shell the driving wheel on the right side is stressed to move upwards and tilt when encountering anobstacle at the moment the left driving wheel bears downward force according to the Mecanum mother wheel obstacle crossing device the driven wheel is driven by the motor to rotate so that the process of crossing obstacles is achieved the driven wheel moves to compress the pressure spring when encountering the obstacles through the pressure spring the effect of crossing the obstacles can beachieved and the obstacle crossing capacity of an original Mecanum mother wheel poor in obstacle crossing function is greatly improved through a series of mechanical structures
