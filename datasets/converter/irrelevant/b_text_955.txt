 CNA     The invention discloses a method and system for starting a modular multilevel matrix converter The method includes initializing the modular multilevel matrix converter Controlled charging according to the realtime sorting voltage equalization strategy the submodule voltage is equalized and charged to the rated value Vsm when the average voltage of the bridge arm branch module reaches the preset rated value UAfter that complete the submodule charging lock all the bridge arm branch modules and then close the AC circuit breaker KM on the other side unlock the modular multilevel matrix converter and maintain the initial pulse output by the converter and the converter The AC voltage difference on both sides is the same The system includes a modular multilevel matrix converter an initialization module an uncontrolled charging module a submodule charging module and an unlocking module The invention can reduce the electrical impact of the modular matrix converter from closing and starting to unlocking protects the safety of the modular matrix converter equipment and improves the stability of the connected system
