 CNA     The invention relates to an internal circulation cooling type coaxial motor axle assembly which includes an axle housing a differential arranged in the axle housing a first output half shaft connected to one end of the differential and a vehicle The drive motor outside the axle housing the motor shaft of the drive motor has a tubular structure and is sleeved on the first output half shaft and one end of the motor shaft extends into the axle housing The circulating pump the heat exchanger the lubricating oil radiating cavity sleeved on the first output semishaft and the lubricating oil heat absorbing cavity sleeved on the lubricating oil radiating cavity between the lubricating oil heatabsorbing cavity and the other motor shaft One end penetrates into the lubricating oil radiating cavity and is butted together with the centrifugal suction tube The invention has the advantage that the lubricating oil circulates inside the axle for cooling and solves the problem that the long route of lubricating oil flowing caused by the existing lubricating oil drawn out of the axle for cooling will affect the viscosity of the oil and affect the quality of the lubricating oil The problem
