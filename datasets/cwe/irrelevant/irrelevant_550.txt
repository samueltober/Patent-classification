 JPA To obtain a manufacturing method which can improve the durability of a large flange part constituting an inner ring for a hub unit bearingSOLUTION A manufacturing method of an inner ring for a hub unit bearing includes a process for obtaining an inner ring raw material  which has a lathing margin  at a point in which a range continuing to an antiraceway side side face  being an inside face in an axial direction via an external peripheral face  from a racewayside side face  being an outside face in the axial direction on a surface of the large flange part  should be formed and in which a thickness of the lathing margin  is thicker than the other point in a point in which an objective portion being a portion including an antiraceway side chamfered part  should be formed a process for performing heat treatment on the inner ring raw material  as a whole and a process for removing the lathing margin  of the inner ring raw material  which has been subjected to the heat treatment by lathing processingSELECTED DRAWING Figure
