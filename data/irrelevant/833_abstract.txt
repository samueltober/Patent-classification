A motor control device  comprises a stepdown device  that comprises a DCoutputtype power conversion device  having a first operation mode in which a first voltage Vdh Vpn is output and a second operation mode in which a second voltage Vdl lower than the first voltage is output a power supply device  and a control device  The motor control device  controls a motor  of a flying object The control device  controls the power conversion device  in the first operation mode if the flying object is away from the ground and controls the power conversion device  in the second operation mode if it is determined that flight information that is one or both of motor parameter information sigmpc sigmp sigmpe obtained in association with control of the motor  and environmental factor information sigev related to the flight altitude of the flying object satisfies a preset condition or if an operation mode signal msig in which the second operation mode is selected on the basis of flight information during control of the motor  is received
