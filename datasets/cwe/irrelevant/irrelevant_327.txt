 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device capable of accurately estimating an input moment from an actual product where indentation is formed when the indentation is formed in a contact area on each of the raceway surfaces of an outer ring and an inner shaft member with rolling elementsSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  includes an outer ring  mounted to a vehicle body side member an inner shaft member  having a flange part  to which a wheel is mounted on one axial side a plurality of rolling elements  rollingly arranged between each of raceway surfaces a b formed on the inner periphery of the outer ring  and each of raceway surfaces a b formed on the outer periphery of the inner shaft member  and a protruded member  protruded from an outer ring end face c on one axial side of the outer ring  and lower in wear resistance than a flange lateral face a opposed to the outer ring end face c at a space S therefrom The axial length of the protruded member  is smaller than the axial length of the space SSELECTED DRAWING Figure
