 JPB To provide a power conversion device which promptly discharges a capacitor of unit converters when stopping a power converterSOLUTION A power conversion device  comprises a power converter  including multiple unit converters  each including a switching element a control circuit which drives and controls the switching element a capacitor which is chargeddischarged by the switching element and a selfpowersupply circuit which is supplied with power from the capacitor and supplies power to the control circuit and being cascaded and a discharge circuit including a switch which is connected in parallel to the capacitor and discharges the capacitor by closing the circuit when the power converter  is stopped a discharge resistor which is connected in series to the switch and a drive circuit which opens the switch when the state where the power converter  is stopped is cancelledSELECTED DRAWING Figure
