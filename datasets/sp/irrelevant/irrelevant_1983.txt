 CNA     The invention relates to the field of automobile suspensions and specifically discloses an automobile semiactive suspension system which includes a shock absorber and a shock absorber spring The shock absorber spring is sleeved on the outside of the shock absorber and the bottom of the shock absorber is detachable The installation has an auxiliary installation mechanism By installing a detachable connecting end on the bottom of the shock absorber the shock absorber and the sleeve can be installed and disassembled simply and quickly The subsequent shock absorber sleeve or connecting end can be replaced separately after damage and the maintenance cost is low During the driving of the vehicle due to the longterm wear and tear of the connecting end at the bottom the probability of damage is relatively high and it is relatively simple to replace it separately which is much lower than the cost of replacing the entire shock absorber The sodium metal inside the plunger can absorb the heat in time avoiding the influence of the heat on the performance of the shock absorber and the connecting end and thus the entire suspension can ensure a good working condition
