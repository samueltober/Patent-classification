 CNA The invention discloses a faulttolerant control method for an automobile active suspension system based on switching control and the method comprises the steps building a mathematic model of the automobile active suspension system under the condition of an uncertain actuator fault and representing the uncertain impact on the control input of the system from the actuator fault uncertainty in amode of the mathematic model designing a faulttolerant controller based on a mathematical model of an active suspension under a fault designing a basic feedback controller in combination with inversion control to ensure a closedloop system problem designing a fault compensation controller for each fault mode and designing a controller capable of solving the corresponding fault mode based onswitching control and using a Lyapunov function method to test the performance of the faulttolerant controller The method mainly solves two key uncertain factors of an actuator fault mode and a fault type ensures that the automobile active suspension system achieves an expected control target under the condition of uncertain actuator faults and obtains ideal performance
