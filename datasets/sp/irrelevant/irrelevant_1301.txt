 CNU The utility model discloses a multistage nonindependent suspension system and a wheeled robot The utility model discloses a multistage nonindependent suspension system The suspension structure comprises two sets of suspension structures and a middle supporting piece each set of suspension structure comprises at least two stages of suspensions two firststage suspensions of the two sets of suspension structures are connected through the middle supporting piece a transition structure with a guiding function is installed between every two adjacent stages of suspensions of each set of suspension structure and two laststage suspensions of the two sets of suspension structures are connected with a rack Rigidity of elastic elements of different stages of suspensions is different to a certain extent and upward jumping and downward jumping of the driving wheel are achieved through combination of the multiple stages of suspensions According to the multistage nonindependent suspension system the guide mechanism is allowed to have a certain swing angle and is limited to swing in one direction and effective contact between the driving wheel and the ground can be guaranteed bymeans of the multistage suspension structure the overall height of the wheeled robot can be kept unchanged or slightly changed under the noload condition and the heavyload condition and thereforethe wheeled robot can be directly submerged into lowbottom equipment such as cars and tool cars and the wheeled robot can be particularly used for ultrathin wheeled robots
