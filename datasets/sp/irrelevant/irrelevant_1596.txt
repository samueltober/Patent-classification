 CNU The invention provides a novel steel plate spring structure which is connected between a vehicle frame and a rear axle and comprises a main steel plate spring and an auxiliary steel plate spring located above the main steel plate spring The main steel plate spring is of a downwardsprotruding arcshaped structure The auxiliary steel plate spring is of an upwardsprotruding arcshaped structureThe length of the auxiliary steel plate spring twoend connecting line is smaller than that of the main steel plate spring twoend connecting line two ends of the auxiliary steel plate spring are connected to the main steel plate spring two ends of the main steel plate spring are respectively hinged with the connecting piece one end away from the main steel plate spring of the connecting piece is hinged to the bottom of the frame an elastic block is arranged at the position above the auxiliary steel plate spring of the bottom of the frame When the load of the electric vehicle is large the elastic blocks below the vehicle frame can be pressed on the auxiliary steel plate springs the main steel plate springs and the auxiliary steel plate springs are stressed synergistically and jointly buffer and absorb shock the shock absorption effect is good the weight is transmitted to the main steel plate springs through the auxiliary steel plate springs and acting points at the two ends of the auxiliary steel plate springs are not located at the two ends of the main steel plate springs Bearing capacity is greatly improved
