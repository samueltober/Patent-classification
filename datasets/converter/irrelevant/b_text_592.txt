 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of power supply and distribution particularly provides a power supply and distribution system based on multistation fusion and aims to solve the technical problem of how to improve the power supply reliability of each power function station in multistation fusion To this end the system according to the embodiment of the invention highly fuses andintegrates a power supply a power grid a load energy storage related devices equipment and the like through a transformer an electric energy conversion device a flexible multistate switch and other devices so the power supply reliability of the system can be improved and continuous stable and reliable power supply can be carried out on the load with a relatively high voltage fluctuationsensitivity degree Besides by controlling the flexible multistate switch the electric energy conversion device and the like power flow mutual assistance and power support between different alternatingcurrent power grids and between different alternatingcurrent buses are achieved the absorption capacity of the distributed power supply station can be improved and the defect of large power flow change caused by plugandplay load access systems of electric vehicles and the defect that the stable operation of the system is not facilitated are overcomed
