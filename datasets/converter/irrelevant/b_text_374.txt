 EPA A control target for a control device  is a vehicle drive device  including a rotating electrical machine MG and the control device  includes an actual rotational speed obtaining part  that obtains an actual rotational speed Nm which is an actual rotational speed of the rotating electrical machine MG an actual torque obtaining part  that obtains actual torque Tm which is actual torque of the rotating electrical machine MG and a determining part  that determines a state of the rotating electrical machine MG The determining part  determines that the state of the rotating electrical machine MG is a negative torque abnormality when the actual torque Tm has a negative value smaller than a torque threshold value THt set based on a relationship between the actual rotational speed Nm and target torque Tmt of the rotating electrical machine MG
