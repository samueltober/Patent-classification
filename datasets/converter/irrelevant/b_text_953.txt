 CNA     The invention discloses a reactive power distribution method suitable for the problem of power imbalance between modules in photovoltaic power generation The method uses a method of injecting reactive power to solve the problem of power imbalance between modules in a photovoltaic power generation system In the photovoltaic medium voltage cascaded converter structure when there is an imbalance caused by the unequal active power of each module the output of each module can be adjusted by injecting a certain amount of reactive power into the system The amplitude of the voltage to effectively reduce the overmodulation phenomenon The reactive power distribution method of the present invention ensures that each module does not have overmodulation and at the same time realizes the balance of the apparent power of each module of the system to the greatest extent and reduces the difference in the size of the power undertaken by each module
