 CNU The spline hub bearing comprises a hub an outer ring a left inner ring a right inner ring and a connecting body a first step and a second step are arranged at the two ends of the inner side of theouter ring respectively and a left sealing ring is fixedly installed on the inner side of the first step The left sealing ring comprises a first framework a first sealing lip and an arcshaped sealing lip the first sealing lip and the arcshaped sealing lip are fixedly installed on the first framework the outer side of the first framework is in interference fit with the axial face of the first step and the right side of the first framework is attached to the radial face of the first step The left side of the protruding part extends outwards in the radial direction to form a shoulder part a plurality of arcshaped grooves which are the same as the arcshaped sealing lips in number and correspond to the arcshaped sealing lips in position are formed in the outer side of the axial face of the shoulder part and the arcshaped sealing lips and the arcshaped grooves are matched to form labyrinth sealing The labyrinth seal is adopted lubrication and friction are not needed and good sealing performance is achieved under the highspeed condition
