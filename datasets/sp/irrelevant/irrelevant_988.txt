 CNU The utility model discloses a supporting beam structure for an automobile air suspension The variable crosssection shaft comprises a uniform crosssection middle shaft section and variable crosssection sections extending from two sides of the middle shaft section the variable crosssection section is symmetrically bent along the radial center of the middle shaft section to form a Cshaped beamstructure a supporting structure is arranged in an inner cavity of the middle shaft section the supporting structure is provided with surface supporting faces and supporting tables the two surfacesupporting faces at least make contact with the two opposite bearing force inner walls in the inner cavity of the middle shaft section respectively and the supporting tables on the two surface supporting faces serve as internal supports of the two opposite bearing force inner walls The device has the advantages that the device is simple in structure the ratio of the cross section factor to thecross section area is larger so that the structure is more reasonable the bending resistance is stronger more reasonable and safer the weight is lighter due to the adoption of a reasonable decrement structure the strength rigidity inherent frequency and resonance phenomenon of the beam are ensured the general requirements are met and the potential safety hazards of unbalance loading breakage and rollover easily caused by different vehicle models are solved
