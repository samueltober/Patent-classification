A cascaded modular multilevel converter for mediumvoltage power electronics systems is disclosed The converter can be used in applications such as an auxiliary power supply for mediumvoltage MV power electronics system or a unidirectional SST which powers a home where very light load conditions are experienced when the home is unoccupied or during the night Unlike the traditional solutions which use a gridfrequency bulky and heavy power transformers the disclosed converter can operate at higher switching frequencies weigh less and provide a higher power density than other approaches Additionally the disclosed converter features an internal capacitor voltage balancing and can achieve power factor correction PFC using predictive control
