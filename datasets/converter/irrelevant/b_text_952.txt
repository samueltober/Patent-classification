 CNA     The present invention discloses a modeling method of power electronic cascade converter based on small step size discretization including the following steps S The expression of the state detection vector S select the appropriate step size in each small step size interval use Eulers method to solve the state equations and turn the state equations into linear equations S set the flag iterate The initial value is iteratively calculated and the appropriate working state equation is selected to calculate the value of each state variable according to the value of the flag bit and state detection vector for each iteration S the iterative result that meets the condition is output The present invention considers the complete dynamic process of all converters in the cascade system and the obtained numerical simulation results will be more in line with actual conditions
