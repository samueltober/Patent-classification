 WOA A vehicle mechanical active suspension mechanism The upper ends of each damping spring  and each shock absorber  in a suspension are connected to a worm gear swing arm  and then the worm gear swing arm is connected to a vehicle body by means of a wormandgear mechanism An ECU controls a servo motor  to drive each worm  to rotate so as to drive the worm gear swing arm  and the suspension connected thereto to generate a lifting motion relative to the vehicle body thereby realizing the height adjustment of the vehicle suspension A lever member  is used to adjust a fulcrum of an upper wishbone  of a transverse double wishbone suspension relative to the vehicle body thereby solving the problem of excessive wheel inclination change during the lifting of the suspension a novel fourbar Yshaped longitudinal swing arm is employed to improve the supporting performance of the suspension a braking mechanism is provided in the middle of an antiroll bar and the disconnected antiroll bars are combined by a dog clutch  thereby overcoming defects of antiroll bars in conventional suspensions and further improving performance thereof
