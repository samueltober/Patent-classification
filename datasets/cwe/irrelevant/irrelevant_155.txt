 JPA To provide a manufacturing method of a wheel bearing which can bring an axial lip of a seal into contact with a lip abutment face by a proper fastening marginSOLUTION In a manufacturing method of a wheel bearing device having an outer ring member  having an outside raceway b an inner shaft member  including a shaft part having an inside raceway a opposing the outside raceway b and a flange part  arranged on one side in an axial direction rather than the outside member  and protruding to the outside from the shaft part in a radial direction a plurality of rolling bodies  arranged between the outside raceway b and the inside raceway a a seal  arranged at an end part of the outer ring member  on one side in the radial direction and having an axial lip a and a lip abutment face c which is arranged at the inner shaft member  side and with which the axial lip a is in contact The manufacturing method includes a step for processing the outside raceway b in a state that a distance in the axial direction from a first reference position c which is set at the outer ring member  is managed and a step for arranging the seal  at a prescribed position of the outer ring member  in the axial direction with the first reference position c as a referenceSELECTED DRAWING Figure
