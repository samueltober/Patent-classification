 CNB     A system and method for grounding a power generation system with a silicon carbide MOSFET power converter are provided The power generation system may include a generator including a multiphase rotor configured to generate multiphase AC power at a first voltage and a power converter including one or more silicon carbide MOSFETs and an isolation transformer The power converter may be configured to convert the multiphase AC power from the generator at the first voltage into the multiphase AC power at the second voltage The power generation system may be electrically grounded so that the leakage current associated with the isolation transformer of the power converter is shunted to the ground terminal
