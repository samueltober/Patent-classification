 DEB     Device for adjusting the level of a vehicle body comprising a rotationally driven axially immovable threaded spindle  and a threaded nut  axially displaceable along the threaded spindle  or a rotationally driven axially immovable threaded nut  with a threaded spindle  axially displaceable along the threaded nut   with a nonrotatably arranged toothed ring  being formed on the outer circumferential surface of the threaded nut  or the threaded spindle which can be driven at least indirectly by an actuator  wherein the actuator  comprises a gear unit  and a drive motor  characterized in that the gear unit  is at least indirectly drivable by the drive motor  A wobble mechanism  the wobble mechanism  comprising a first gear  which is arranged on an eccentric  and which can be set into a wobbling movement by rotating the eccentric  wherein the first gear  rotates a ring gear  through the wobbling movement and at least indirectly drives the ring gear  and the wobble gear  has a locking disc  for continuously locking the gear unit   according to which an acting retroactive torque cannot cause any adjustment of the eccentric  arranged in the gear unit  and a displacement of the threaded spindle  relative to the threaded nut  therefore only takes place by actively actuating the drive motor
