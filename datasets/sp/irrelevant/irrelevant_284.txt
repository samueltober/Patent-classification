 USA A method for estimating damping characteristics of shock absorbers in an active or semiactive suspension involves providing a reference model of a nominal relation between a road severity index related to vertical acceleration values and the mean driving current of the control valves of the shock absorbers acquiring respective relative acceleration or speed data of at least the front wheels of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle body determining a value of the road severity index starting from relative acceleration or speed data of the front wheels of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle body acquiring values representative of the mean driving current of the control valve of each shock absorber comparing acquired value of the mean driving current with an expected value of the nominal mean driving current determined as a function of the road severity index according to the reference model and determining a degradation condition if the acquired value does not correspond to the expected value
