The invention discloses a multitimescale transient modeling method for a cascaded converter of a power electronic power grid Firstly converter highfrequency switch transient characteristics are described based on a wave process description function an equivalent controlled voltage source and a controlled current source of the cascaded converter submodule are designed through a wave process semianalytic function then a Fourier series and frequency moving method is used frequency shift phasor functions of an equivalent controlled voltage source and a controlled current source of the cascaded converter are designed and then the semianalytic function and the frequency shift phasor function are combined to construct a cascaded converter multitimescale transient model the formed model can be directly docked with an external power grid and multitimescale transient accurate and rapid simulation of the power electronic power grid is realized
