 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To realize a drive unit for wheels capable of suppressing the occurrence of a stickslip phenomenon at an abutting portion between a hub unit bearing and a constant velocity joint    SOLUTION A first abutting surface  having a spiral first streak is provided on an axially inner end surface of an inner ring  constituting an axially inner end of a hub  In addition a spiral second streak whose winding direction as viewed from the axial direction is the same as the first streak is formed on the radial outer portion of the axial outer surface of the bottom  constituting the outer ring  for the joint A second abutting surface  which is lower in hardness than the abutting surface  is provided When connecting the hub unit bearing and the constant velocity joint the second abutting surface  is abutted against the first abutting surface  so that the first streak bites into the second streak
