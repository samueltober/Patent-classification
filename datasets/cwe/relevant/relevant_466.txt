 JPB To enhance cooling performance of a bearing cap having a cap body made of a synthetic resin to suppress the temperature rise of a hub unit bearingSOLUTION A resin bottom plate part a of a cap body a molded with a resin material in which a reinforcing material having excellent thermal conductivity is compounded has annular projections a b each axially extending from both side surfaces in the axial direction and symmetrically provided in the axial direction in which a fibrous reinforcing material is axially oriented inside the annular projections a and b provided symmetrically in the axial direction After heat inside a bearing is absorbed from the annular projection a on an outboard side the heat is radiated to an external space from the annular projection b on an inboard side through the reinforcing materialSELECTED DRAWING Figure
