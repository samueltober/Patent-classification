 CNB The invention discloses a current source type electrolytic capacitorfree high frequency link converter system A converter comprises an input port an input capacitor two sets of interleaved currentsource type high frequency isolated DCDC converters in an inputparallel outputseries mode a voltage source type threephase inverter a filter circuit and an output port wherein the frontstageDCDC converter adopts a secondary side voltage clamping technology based on model predictive control and flexibly adjusts a secondary side clamping switch tube to realize the soft switching of the converter in a wide load range and reduce the conduction loss at a light load the backstage inverter adopts a new modulation method to reduce the requirements of a decoupling capacitance value on theDC side uses a thinfilm capacitor to replace an electrolytic capacitor and further improves the power density and reliability of the converter In addition a new control strategy is adopted thehigh frequency link converter can be applied in a gridconnected mode the phenomenon that a distributed energy storage system requires separate power converters in an uninterruptible power supply mode and the gridconnected mode respectively can be avoided and the power density of the whole system can be improved
