 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of planetary reduction mechanisms and relates to a noise reduction gear ring a planetary reduction mechanism a hub an output shaft assembly and a vehicle The noise reduction gear ring comprises a gear ring body and a plurality of first splines arranged on the end face of one side of the gear ring body A plurality of inner teeth extending in the axial direction of the gear ring body are formed on the inner side wall of the gear ring body A first spline groove is formed between every two adjacent first splines first clamping grooves extending in the circumferential direction of the noise reduction gear ring are formed in the inner side surfaces of the first splines and the first clamping grooves in the multiple first splines are located in the same circumference The noise reduction gear ring can be buckled and matched with the second spline of the hub through the first spline so that the hub and the noise reduction gear ring areassembled
