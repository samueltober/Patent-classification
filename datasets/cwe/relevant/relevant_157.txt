 JPB To attain a structure of a hub unit bearing capable of preventing indentation from being formed on an outer ring raceway or inner ring raceway without accelerating destabilization in behavior of a vehicleSOLUTION A hub a comprises a rotary flange a having a discoid solid part  and a flange part  projecting radially outward from an outer peripheral part of the solid part  and a hollow cylindrical shaft part  projecting axially inward from an axial inside surface of the rotary flange  and having double row inner ring raceways a b on an outer peripheral surface Further the hub a has at a portion positioned on an axially outward side with respect to the axially outward side inner ring raceway a a stress wave prevention part configured to prevent stress waves occurring in the rotary flange  from being transmitted to an axial intermediate part of the shaft part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
