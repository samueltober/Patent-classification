A power converter circuit that includes a switch circuit and multiple phase and amplifier circuits may generate a voltage level on a regulated power supply node of a computer system The amplifier circuits may generate respective demand currents using a voltage level of the regulated power supply node and a reference voltage In response to activation of a multiphase operating mode the switch circuit may short the outputs of the amplifier circuits to generate a common demand current The multiple phase circuits may sequentially source current to regulated power supply node using the common demand current
