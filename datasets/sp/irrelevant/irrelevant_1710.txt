 CNA The invention relates to a vehicle semiactive suspension integrated control method and a control system The method comprises the following steps obtaining control damping to control a suspension if a vehicle is about to roll laterally enhancing the damping according to lateral acceleration and then controlling the suspension if the vehicle is about to pitch enhancing the damping according to the longitudinal acceleration and then controlling the suspension and if the vehicle is about to roll and pitch enhancing and superposing the damping according to the lateral acceleration and the longitudinal acceleration to serve as control damping to control the suspension According to the method roll and pitch principles are combined the suspension damping is actively adjusted according to a vehicle body posture pitch and roll in the vehicle driving process intervention is performed in advance roll and pitch of the vehicle body are effectively restrained on the basis that vehicle riding comfort and driving safety are both considered and the stability of the vehicle driving posture is improved
