 EPA A reduction gear includes a first bearing that is mounted on a supporting member an output member that is supported by the first bearing and rotates about a first rotation axis an internal gear that is coupled to the output member and rotates about the first rotation axis together with the output member a second bearing that is mounted on the supporting member on an outer side relative to the first bearing in a radial direction and a pinion gear that is supported by the second bearing rotates about a second rotation axis different from the first rotation axis and is engaged with the internal gear At least a part of the second bearing is located on a side closer to the internal gear with respect to a plane passing through an end portion of the first bearing that is more distant from the internal gear in an axial direction parallel to the second rotation axis and being orthogonal to the second rotation axis
