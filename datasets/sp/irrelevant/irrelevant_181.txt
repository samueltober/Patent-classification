 USA A stabilizer adhesive bearing for a vehicle stabilizer may comprise an annular sleeve having a resilient inner contour for coaxial arrangement on the vehicle stabilizer The resilient inner contour of the annular sleeve may comprise on a side facing the vehicle stabilizer a threedimensionally structured surface with an adhesive receiving volume The threedimensionally structured surface has a maximum roughness depth Rmax greater than  m and a core roughness depth RK of at least  relative to the maximum roughness depth Rmax of the threedimensionally structured surface The maximum roughness depth Rmax is a total of the reduced tip height Rpk and the reduced groove depth Rvk Further the reduced tip height Rpk the reduced groove depth Rvk and the core roughness depth RK may be determined in accordance with EN ISO  December
