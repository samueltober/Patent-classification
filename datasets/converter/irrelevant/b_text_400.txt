 CNA The invention discloses a novel asymmetric threelevel midpoint clamping type power converter and belongs to the field of novel power converter design Compared with an asymmetric halfbridge type power converter two power triodes and two clamping diodes are added to each phase of the power converter multilevel control of a switched reluctance motor system can be achieved the control mode ismore flexible and the maximum bearing voltage of the power triodes is reduced In addition a rotating speed and current double closedloop pulse width modulation PWM strategy is given for a novelswitched reluctance motor system based on an asymmetric threelevel neutralpoint clamped power converter Compared with a traditional PWM control strategy the control strategy has the advantages that current closedloop control is added and a better current control effect is achieved A fivesection type working mode distribution mode can effectively restrain the problem of midpoint potential deviation caused by unbalanced charging and discharging of the capacitor Multiple effective working modes are reasonably utilized the advantages of the power converter can be brought into play to a great extent and the control performance of the system is optimized
