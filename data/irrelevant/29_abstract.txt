A switched capacitor power converter  includes a charge pump having active semiconductor switch elements MA MB that electrically interconnect charge pump capacitors CACB to one another in successive states to form a plurality of charge transfer paths Switch driving circuits  each with a control input AaBb power connections and a drive output are coupled to and for control of one or more of the switch elements The plurality of charge transfer paths comprise at least a first charge transfer path and a second transfer path The first charge transfer path includes at least one switch of the plurality of switches and is operable via a particular gate driver of the corresponding gate drivers based at least in part on the one or more driver signals to be received by the particular gate driver The particular gate driver is powered by a charge stored on at least one capacitor coupled along the second charge transfer path The charge pump may be a multiphase cascade multiplier
