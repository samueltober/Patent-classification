The invention discloses a control method of a singlephase cascaded fullbridge multilevel converter and the multilevel converter and the control method comprises the following steps obtaining aninput voltage an inductive current and an output voltage of a fullbridge unit and generating a modulated wave signal obtaining a carrier signal of each bridge arm in the fullbridge unit comparing the modulated wave signal with each carrier signal to obtain a comparison result the bridge arms being divided into a basic bridge arm and a mirror image bridge arm and the carrier signal of the basic bridge arm being the same as the carrier signal of the mirror image bridge arm and controlling the switching action of the corresponding bridge arm based on the comparison result so that the switching action of each basic bridge arm is opposite to the switching action of the mirror image bridge arm According to the invention the carrier phase shift angles of the bridge arms are symmetrically configured so that the basic bridge arm and the mirror image bridge arm thereof can generate noises with the same size and opposite directions the noises are canceled out and the commonmode interference is effectively inhibited
