 USB A semiactive antiroll stabilizer bar capable of controlling the stiffness thereof by virtue of the elastic force of a spring is disclosed When the stabilizer bar is rotated during general travelling the stabilizer bar has roll stiffness attributable to the repulsive force due to the spring constant thereof When the stabilizer bar is greatly rotated during turning of the vehicle the springs are closely compressed with the result that the stabilizer bar has the same high stiffness as that of a general stabilizer bar
