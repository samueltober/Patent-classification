 USB Circuits and methods for power conversion In some examples a modular multilevel converter MMC is configured for power conversion between an alternating current AC bus and a direct current DC bus The MMC includes submodules arranged into a phase leg for at least one phase of the AC bus Each submodule includes an energy storage component and a switch configured for bypassing the energy storage component or connecting the energy storage component into the phase leg The MMC includes a precharger circuit configured to precharge the energy storage components of the submodules The precharger circuit is configured for providing a first DC voltage that is lower than a second DC voltage on the DC bus and the precharger circuit is coupled to an end submodule of the phase leg
