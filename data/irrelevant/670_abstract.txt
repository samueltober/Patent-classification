According to the energy storage type vehicle network resonance treatment device provided by the utility model highorder and loworder harmonic filtering of a traction power supply system is realizedthrough the energy storage type active filter and the highpass filter so that the resonance problem of a traction network and an electric locomotive is effectively solved and the reactive compensation function of a traction substation can be realized the energy storage type active filter can effectively utilize regenerative braking energy fed back by an electric locomotive and can feed back apower grid when traction power is large economic benefits are remarkable in addition the energy storage type active filter adopts a highvoltage direct hanging mode the compensation effect is good the efficiency is high and the energy storage type active filter is suitable for largescale popularization and application And meanwhile the occupied area is small and a bypass function is matched so that relatively high redundancy and reliability are realized
