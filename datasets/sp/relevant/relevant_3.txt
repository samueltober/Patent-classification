 CNA The invention relates to a bearing springdamper system of a vehicle wheel having a hydraulic vibration damper  consisting of a damper cylinder  and a damper piston  guided therein the piston rod  of which hydraulic vibration damper is fastened to the vehicle body  whilst the damper cylinder is supported to a wheel guiding element and in which a pretension spring  is clamped functionally between the damper piston and a pretension piston  which can be displaced hydraulically in the longitudinal direction of the piston rod  The pretension piston is supported hydraulically with respect to the damper cylinder by means of a support chamber  filled with the hydraulic medium of the vibration damper and can be displaced by means of a conveying device  which conveys hydraulic medium into or out of the support chamber The pretension spring is parallelconnected in every possible position of the pretension piston of the bearing spring ultimately clamped between the vehicle bodywork and the wheel for force transmission
