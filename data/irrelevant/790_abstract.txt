The invention discloses an efficiency evaluation method and system for a distributed renewable energy power generation system The method comprises the steps of carrying out the link division of the distributed renewable energy power generation system and building an efficiency evaluation index model for each link substituting the collected historical data into an efficiency evaluation index model within preset historical data collection time calculating historical efficiency evaluation values of all links and dividing the historical efficiency evaluation values into n efficiency levels adopting a support vector machine model training algorithm to carry out model training on each link and establishing a state evaluation model of each link calculating the latest efficiency evaluation value of each link taking the latest efficiency evaluation value as the input of the state evaluation model and outputting the latest system working state under each link and judging the efficiency level of each link according to the latest efficiency evaluation value and returning check and optimization suggestions of the link in a set evaluation period according to the operation efficiency index and the state evaluation result
