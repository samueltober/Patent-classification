 DEB     A suspension assembly  between a sprung member  and an unsprung member   comprisingan active suspension system   which is arranged between the sprung element  and the unsprung element   and comprises a controllable loadbearing spring element a member   of negative stiffness disposed between the sprung member  and the unsprung member   and comprising a first and a second rigid member     the are arranged opposite to one another are coupled to a connection   and each have a prestressing force  which is exerted on distal ends of the rigid elements     in the direction of the connection   becomeswherein the element   with negative stiffness has a negative stiffness constant which counteracts a positive spring rate of the active suspension system   in order to achieve a total spring stiffness of the suspension assembly  under static conditionssaid member   having negative stiffness comprising opposed fluid cylinders   in which are pistons each connected to the rigid members   at the distal ends andwherein the fluid cylinders   are fixed in a frame  which is connected to the sprung element
