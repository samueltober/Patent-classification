 JPB To attain a structure capable of making durability of an outer ring raceway radially overlapped a stationary flange substantially uniform over the whole circumferenceSOLUTION At an axial position where an outer ring raceway b and a stationary flange  overlap radially between a diameter D of an outer peripheral surface of an outer ring  deviated in a circumferential direction from a large flange part  a diameter D of a virtual circle inscribed at a screw groove bottom part  of a screw hole  with a central axis X of the outer ring  as a center and a diameter D of a virtual circle inscribed at a screw top part  of the screw hole  with the central axis X of the outer ring  as a center the following relationship is established DDDSELECTED DRAWING Figure
