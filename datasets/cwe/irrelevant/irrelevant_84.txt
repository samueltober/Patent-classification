 CNU The utility model provides a stop mechanism for an inner ring of a hub bearing The shaft head structure comprises a shaft head with a limiting step surface and a hub the wheel hub is sleeved on theshaft head through a wheel hub inner bearing and a wheel hub outer bearing which are arranged in an inner cavity of the wheel hub the hub inner bearing abuts against the limiting step face of the shaft head through the bearing seat ring to conduct limiting the hub outer bearing is locked and fixed through the locking nut the bearing seat ring is connected with the shaft head in an interferencefit mode and inner rings of the hub inner bearing and the hub outer bearing are connected with the shaft head in a clearance fit mode The inner ring of the hub inner bearing and the bearing seat ring limit circumferential twisting of the hub inner bearing relative to the shaft head through a circumferential limiting structure between the binding faces of the hub inner bearing and the bearing seat ring and the inner ring of the hub outer bearing and the locking nut limit circumferential twisting of the hub outer bearing relative to the shaft head through a circumferential limiting structurebetween the binding faces of the hub outer bearing and the locking nut The utility model solves the problems that the hub bearing is difficult to assemble and maintain the inner circle of the hub bearing runs out the clearance of the maintenancefree hub bearing cannot be adjusted and the machining precision requirement of parts is high
