 CNA The invention discloses an intelligent platform test vehicle for a lowchassis telescopic suspension and a control method of the intelligent platform test vehicle The intelligent platform test vehicle comprises a vehicle body module a wheel passive retraction mechanism module a steering module and a control system the wheel passive retraction mechanism module is arranged at the bottom of the vehicle body module and the bottom of the steering module the wheel passive retraction mechanism module shrinks when being collided and the height of the whole vehicle body is reduced and the steering module is used for connecting the wheel passive retraction mechanism module and the vehicle body module to complete steering of the platform test vehicle and the control system is arranged on a bottom plate of the wheel passive retraction mechanism module and a vehicle body frame According to the invention path planning can be carried out autonomously under the condition of simultaneous drilling of multiple subjects various working conditions such as lane changing overtaking meeting sudden stop and the like are realized and when inevitable collision occurs the passive suspension contracts after collision and compression so that the overall height of the platform test vehicle is greatly reduced the chassis is prevented from being damaged due to excessive stress the service life is prolonged and normal operation of military drilling is ensured
