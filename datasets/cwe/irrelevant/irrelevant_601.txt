 CNA The invention discloses an electric vehicle diecasting hub with an embedded bushing The hub comprises a hub body a bushing is arranged on the inner wall of the center of the hub body a bearing step is integrally formed at an end opening of the bushing a bearing groove is formed between the bearing step and the bushing a bearing is connected into the bearing groove in a clamped mode and a wheel shaft is connected into the bearing in an inserted mode The bushing made of steel and the hub are integrally formed the space formed by the bushing and the bearing step can carry a bearing thebumping force and impact force generated in the running process of the electric vehicle can be finally transmitted to the bushing to be absorbed and the bushing made of steel is additionally arrangedin a diecasting mode during hub machining the supporting strength of the hub is improved through the hardness of the steel material of the bushing the advantage of uniform stress is achieved thestrength of the hub is guaranteed through the hardness of the steel material after the hub is impacted by various reasons the bushing absorbs various forces the hardness of the bushing increases the resistance of the hub in all aspects and the effect of enhancing the strength of the hub is achieved
