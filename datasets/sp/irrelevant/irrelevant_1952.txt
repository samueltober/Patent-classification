 WOA The present invention realizes a structure for a suspension device  that can be readily assembled and can readily secure the total contraction amount possible by a coil spring A bearing unit  is disposed between a section of a ball screw shaft  on the other axial side and an upper shell  A side surface on the one axial side of a pressing plate  that constitutes the bearing unit  and is prevented from rotating relative to the upper shell  is abutted against a side surface on the other axial side of a flange section  of the upper shell  with a stopper holder  therebetween The bearing unit  supports the ball screw shaft  in the upper shell in a manner enabling rotation of the ball screw shaft  The circumscribed circle diameter of a ball nut  and an inner tube  is smaller than the inner diameter dimension of the flange section  In other words an intermediate assembly  including the ball nut  and the inner tube  can pass through the inner side in the radial direction of the flange section  of the upper shell  during assembly of the suspension device
