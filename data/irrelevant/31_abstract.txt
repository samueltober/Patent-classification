PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide electric vehicles that in instances in which separate motors drive different wheels of a vehicle do not require dedicated power converters for each of the motorsSOLUTION Electric motors     are connected to a DC power supply  by a parallel modular converter  that includes a plurality of parallel power converters  that convert the DC power to AC power The parallel modular converter selectively connects different parallel power converters to different ones of the electric motors to provide an adequate supply of electrical power to meet load conditions of the electric motors As the load conditions of the electric motors dynamically change the parallel modular converter can selectively connect certain parallel power converters to different motors to satisfy the changing load conditionsSELECTED DRAWING Figure A
