 CNU The utility model discloses an FSAE racing car doublecrossarm suspension antitilting device which comprises two crossarm suspensions each crossarm suspension comprises a stand column connected to a wheel edge the edge of each stand column is connected with one end of a push rod through a knuckle bearing the other end of each push rod is connected with a rocking piece through a shaft and the rocking pieces are connected to a car frame in a rotating mode The swing piece is further sequentially connected with a torsion arm connecting rod and a torsion arm the two torsion arms are fixedly connected through a torsion rod spring and the two ends of the torsion rod spring both penetrate out of the torsion arm to be connected to the frame On the basis of an ordinary doublecrossarm independent suspension a torsion rod spring is introduced to serve as an antitilting rod meanwhile the effect of a third spring is achieved the requirement for the arrangement space of the antitilting rod of the formula car is greatly reduced and meanwhile the system mass is obviously reduced on the original basis the maneuverability of the vehicle is improved from two aspects of vehicle roll gradient control and vehicle weight control
