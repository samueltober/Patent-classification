 CNB The application relates to an energyreclaiming vibration absorber The energyreclaiming vibration absorber comprises a first sleeve a second sleeve a reversing mechanism a first oneway clutch asecond oneway clutch a planetary gear train mechanism an electric energy transformation mechanism and a connecting seat wherein no matter whether the first sleeve and the second sleeve move in opposite directions or in mutual deviation directions the rotating directions of an input shaft are the same In the prior art a second oneway clutch is arranged at the center of a sun wheel According to the energyreclaiming vibration absorber disclosed by the application only a first connecting hole allowing a shaft sleeve to penetrate is formed in the center of the sun wheel the diameter ofthe shaft sleeve is smaller than that of the second oneway clutch the diameter of the sun wheel is small then the whole diameter of the planetary gear train mechanism is reduced and the diametersof the first sleeve and the second sleeve are reduced so that the diameter of the energyreclaiming vibration absorber is small the volume is low and light weight design is realized and thereofthe integral performance of an automobile is improved by the energyreclaiming vibration absorber
