Power electronic devices including weldingtype power supplies may have switchmode power supplies that can be configured in two or more topologies The detection circuit system of the power electronic device can determine the configuration topology of the switchmode power supply and the input voltage supplied to the power electronic device The detection circuit system andor control circuit system of the power electronic device can verify whether the configuration topology of the switch mode power supply corresponds to the supplied input voltage and can indicate an error when the configuration topology does not correspond to the supplied input voltage
