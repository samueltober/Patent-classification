The present specification provides a multiphase converter and relates to a technique for detecting an abnormality in a current sensor  connected to each of a plurality of boost converter circuitsad connected in parallel Multiphase converters ad disclosed in the present specification is provided with a current sensor  A controller  calculates an estimated value IALL of the total input current input to the multiphase converter When the difference between the estimated value IALL and the sum of the measured values of all the current sensors  deviates from a predetermined allowable range the controller  outputs an abnormality notification signal indicating an abnormality in the current sensors Since the multiphase converter  uses the estimated value IALL of the total input current input to the multiphase converter the increase in the processing load of the controller  is small even if the number of connected boost converter circuits increases
