The present invention is a computationallyefficient compensator for removing nonlinear distortion The compensator operates in a digital postcompensation configuration for linearization of devices or systems such as analogtodigital converters and RF receiver electronics The compensator also operates in a digital precompensation configuration for linearization of devices or systems such as digitaltoanalog converters RF power amplifiers and RF transmitter electronics The multidimensional compensator effectively removes linear and nonlinear distortion in these systems by accurately modeling the state of the device by tracking multiple functions of the input including but not limited to present signal value delay function derivative function including higher order derivatives integral function including higher order integrals signal statistics mean median standard deviation variance covariance function power calculation function RMS or peak or polynomial functions The multidimensional compensator can be adaptively calibrated using simple arithmetic operations that can be completed with low processing requirements and quickly to track parameters that rapidly change over time temperature power level such as in frequencyhopping systems
