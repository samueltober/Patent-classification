 CNB The invention discloses a Taylor series HHH timedelay compensation control method for a magnetorheological semiactive suspension The Taylor series HHH timedelay compensation control method writes time delay into a firstorder Taylor series timedelay equation and constitutes an augmented state equation with a suspension system state equation Directed against the augmented state equation an H norm is utilized to constrain comprehensive performance indexes of the suspension and then the H norm is utilized to constrain a predictive control force at a next timedelay moment Then directed against the suspension system state equation another H controller is utilized to obtain an ideal control force and a Taylor series HHH timedelay compensation controller is designedThe timedelay compensation controller takes suspension state variables and the output of the ideal H controller as the input and takes the predictive control force at the next timedelay moment asthe output to obtain a control current signal and then the control current signal is input into a numerical control current source to obtain actual control currents of a magnetorheological damper soas to achieve the timedelay compensation control for the magnetorheological semiactive suspension
