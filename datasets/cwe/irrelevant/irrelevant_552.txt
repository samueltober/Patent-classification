 CNA The invention discloses a hub assembly and a vehicle The hub assembly comprises a hub body a half shaft a clutch device and a driving assembly the half shaft penetrates through the hub body the clutch device is arranged between the half shaft and the hub body the clutch device is provided with a combining position and a separating position and when the clutch device is located at the combining position the clutch device performs transmission between the half shaft and the hub body and when the clutch device is located at the separation position the clutch device interrupts transmission between the half shaft and the hub body and the driving assembly drives the clutch device to be switched between the combination position and the separation position By arranging the driving assembly and the clutch device power separation and combination between the half shaft and the hub body are achieved power transmission between the half shaft and the hub body can be cut off when a vehicle is in a noload state or a loadcarrying part is large the dragging resistance and inertia resistance of a gear of an axle during cruise driving can be reduced the service life of the axle is prolonged and the vehicle fuel economy and the system transmission efficiency can be improved
