 CNB The invention relates to a power electronic transformer with true bipolar DC output ability By controlling a switch tube of a fullbridgethreelevel combined converter  the balance of anode andcathode DC output voltage is realized and the normal operation of nonfault pole DC output under a single pole fault condition is realized by controlling a fullbridge converter  and the fullbridgethreelevel combined converter  the original secondary side voltage of an isolation transformer  is adjusted so that bidirectional transmission adjustment of input and output side power isrealized a soft switch of a switch device in the converter can be realized so that the operation efficiency of the converter is enhanced the designed converter can be combined with a cascaded H bridge converter or a modularized multilevel converter to form the power electronic transformer with mediumhighvoltage AC input and true bipolar DC output and a DC converter with true bipolar DC output ability can be formed through seriesparallel connection of modules
