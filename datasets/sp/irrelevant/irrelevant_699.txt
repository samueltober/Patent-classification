 CNA The invention provides a maintenancefree rubber bushing assembly Two half bearing ball bowls axially sleeve a spherical pin through connecting handles the two half bearing ball bowls are connectedinto a bearing ball bowl body through male and female threads and the spherical surface is wrapped with the bearing ball bowl body to form a wrapped structure end caps are arranged on the two sidesoutside the bearing ball bowl body and the outer side of the end caps and the outer side of the bearing ball bowl body are filled with a filler which is polyurethane or rubber so that the end caps and the bearing ball bowl body are in vulcanized connection to form one body Oil return grooves of a structure shaped like the Arabic numeral  are formed in the spherical surface of the spherical pin The two half bearing ball bowls are connected through the male and female threads into the bearing ball bowl body a connecting line is formed in the connection portion the influence on force in the axial and radical directions of the spherical surface is limited and the service life is prolonged the polyurethane or the rubber are convenient to use and manufacture and the shockabsorption and connecting effects are good The oil return grooves of the structure shaped like the Arabic numeral  are crossed and extend to the middle from the two ends of the spherical pin lifelong benefitsare achieved simply by onetime lubrication and the maintenancefree aim is achieved
