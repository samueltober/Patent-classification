 WOA The present invention addresses the problem of providing a bearing cap that is for a vehicle wheelbearing apparatus with a rotational speed detection device that is capable of efficiently discharging outside a sensor support part foreign matter having entered inside the sensor support part and that ensures the rigidity of the sensor support part and a vehicle wheelbearing apparatus with a rotational speed detection device In a bearing cap  in which a sensor support part  is formed on a bottom surface section c of a cap body  and in which an insertion hole a for a rotational speed sensor  is formed in the sensor support part  a recess d that accommodates a tip portion of the rotational speed sensor  is formed in the portion of the bottom surface section c where the sensor support part  is formed The sensor support part  includes a first wall section b and a second wall section c that are disposed facing each other across a virtual line L passing through a center axis G of the bottom surface section c and a center axis G of the insertion hole a and that are formed along the circumferential edge of the recess d Protrusions d protruding from the bottom surface section c are continuously provided on the outer circumferential surfaces of the first wall section b and the second wall section c
