 CNU The utility model discloses a twostage damping mechanism of an omnidirectional moving chassis The twostage damping mechanism comprises a chassis keel and a wheel set module Wheel set modules arearranged at the four corners of the chassis keel respectively and each wheel set module comprises a power motor a Mecanum wheel and a secondstage damping mechanism Two fanshaped carbon plates arearranged on the two sides of the secondstage damping mechanism firststage damping is fixed to the fanshaped carbon plates the upper end of the firststage damping is connected with a doorshapedframe and the doorshaped frame is matched with a pin shaft a spring a guide wheel a spring seat and a linear bearing to form secondstage damping According to the omnidirectional mobile chassis selfshock of the Mecanum wheels can be effectively filtered out through firststage shock absorption the requirement for stability of the chassis in most application scenes is met and the omnidirectional mobile chassis can adapt to various complex and severe terrains through a secondstage shock absorption mechanism formed by the omnidirectional mobile chassis and secondstage shock absorption
