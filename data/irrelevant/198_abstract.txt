The invention relates to a device suitable for monitoring and receiving multisystem navigation signals The device comprises a radio frequency processing module and the like and is characterized in that radio frequency signals processed by a receiving antenna and a lownoise amplifier enter a radio frequency processing module first to complete analog downconversion processing so as to obtain analog intermediatefrequency signals the monitoring and receiving multisystem navigation signals subjected to AD sampling enter the intermediatefrequency processing unit of an intermediatefrequencyand information processing module to complete intermediatefrequency processing and antiinference processing so as to obtain digital intermediatefrequency signals the digital intermediatefrequencysignals enter a baseband processing module to complete signal dispreading and demodulation then the signals are transmitted to the information processing unit of the intermediatefrequency and information processing module and calculating is performed to obtain needed observation data the observation data is transmitted to external data processing software by an interface module through a network port so as to complete navigation signal monitoring The device is small in size low in power consumption high in integration level high in measuring precision and capable of receiving all thecivil signals of the Beidou global system GPS GLONASS and Galileo system
