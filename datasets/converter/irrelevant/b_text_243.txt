 USB An integrated power supply system for auxiliary services for power converters comprises a sinusoidal filter connected between an auxiliary output of a DCAC inverter module and an input of the auxiliary service transformer in such a way that a control module by means of control commands interrupts the main output of the DCAC inverter module and enables the secondary output thereof to allow the auxiliary service transformer to generate the auxiliary AC power The DCAC inverter module is connectable to a DC source and supplies the power it generates to an AC network
