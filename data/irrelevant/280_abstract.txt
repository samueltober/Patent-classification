A bidirectional switch for the control of power from an AC source to a load is described The approach uses power MOSFETs in a bidirectional switch subcircuit configuration having an optically coupled electrically floating control circuit that selfbiases the switches into the on state and uses an optically coupled control element to force the switches into the off state The time constant of the control circuit is fast enough to allow phase control as well as onoff control A boost circuit is included to ensure that the control voltage exceeds a threshold voltage of the MOSFETs to force an off state A plurality of subcircuits can be easily cascaded to provide improved performance
