 JPA To suppress interference between an attachment member and a lip part when a plurality of sealing devices are laminated on one anotherSOLUTION A hub unit sealing device comprises an annular seal member  composed of an elastic material which is fastened to an annular fixed member  fixed to an outer ring  and the fixed member includes a cylinder part a extending in an axial direction of a hub shaft and a first bent face  bent inward in a radial direction of the hub shaft from an end part of a first orientation of the cylinder part in the axial direction The seal member includes a lip part c extending in the axial direction a cylindrical covering part a for covering the cylinder part and a second bent face bent outward in the radial direction from an end part of a second orientation opposite to the first orientation of the covering part A length of the lip part in the axial direction is shorter than a length of a region in the axial direction in which the cylinder part and the first bent face are matched to each other a range of the first bent face in the radial direction and a range of the second bent face in the radial direction are overlapped on each other and at least either of the first bent face and the second bent face is formed into a circular arc shape or a tapered shapeSELECTED DRAWING Figure
