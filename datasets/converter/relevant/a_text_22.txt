 CHB     The invention relates to a modular multilevel power converter which has several phases with phase branches  each with an upper arm  and a lower arm  each of the arms   being a serial connection of a plurality of MMC modules and an arm inductance  and the MMC modules are controllable voltage sources There is an active filter module  per phase which has a first connection that is connected to the upper center connection of the phase a second connection that is connected to the lower center connection of the phase and a third connection that is connected to is connected to the phase connection of the phase The active filter module  has an intermediate circuit voltage between an upper connection point P and a lower connection point N and for each of the three connections of the filter module  there is a bridge branch with which either the upper or the lower Connection point can be connected to the respective connection
