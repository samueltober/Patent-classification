 CNA The invention discloses an armorbreaking and killing composite warhead device with adjustable damage power The armorbreaking and killing composite warhead device comprises an end cover a shell body prefabricated fragments a main charge a shaped charge cover a baffle ring and a detonating deviceand the device is characterized in that one end of the shell body is connected with the end cover the other end of the shell body is connected with the shaped charge cover through the baffle ring the main charge is filled in the shell body a plurality of layers are arranged between the shellbody and the main charge a plurality of prefabricated fragments are arranged on each layer the detonating device comprises a base plate and a booster tube and the base plate is arranged between theend cover and the main charge and is connected with the booster tube According to the armorbreaking and killing composite warhead device with the adjustable damage power through detonation of different input points such as a center singlepoint detonation input point an end face multipoint detonation input point and an axis array multipoint detonation input point the charging detonation mode is changed pressure distribution of detonation waves on the shell body and the shaped charge cover is controlled and therefore the fact that the damage mode can be converted and the fragment power level can be controlled is realized
