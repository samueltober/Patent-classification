 CNA The invention provides a Ushaped spline hub bearing and driving shaft connecting structure which comprises a shaft wheel a sealing ring and a spline sleeve The shaft wheel comprises an outer wheel a steel ball a retainer an inner wheel and a sealing ring the small end of the shaft wheel fixes the inner wheel through spin riveting Ushaped splines formed by connecting an inner hole an end face and an outer circle into a whole are machined at the spin riveting end of the shaft wheel and each key is in tapershaped smooth transition at the joint of the end face the outer circle and the inner hole The spline shell is sleeved on the end portion of the Ushaped spline of the shaft wheel a Ushaped ring groove is arranged on the end face of the spline shell Ushaped spline teeth which are connected into a whole are arranged on the inner diameter face the groove bottom face and the outer diameter face of the ring groove and the spline teeth are connected with the Ushaped spline on the end portion of the shaft wheel in a meshed mode The Ushaped spline hub bearing is in threeface meshing connection torque transmission is carried out after the Ushaped spline is connected with a driving shaft unit the positioning precision is improved the driving torque is improved the weight of the hub bearing is reduced light weight and miniaturization are achieved the friction torque of the bearing is reduced and the purpose of reducing energy consumption is achieved
