 CNA The invention provides an air spring height adjusting system and method for a mediumlowspeed maglev train A traditional mechanical height adjusting rod is replaced with a height sensor the phenomenon that a knuckle bearing at the rod end of the height adjusting rod is stuck is avoided and the reliability of the whole system is improved a dead zone or an insensitive zone is arranged in a control processing module through a computer program the insensitive zone can be optimized according to a vehicle structure and load characteristics the problem that a traditional mechanical height adjusting valve cannot optimize the insensitive zone after a product is formed is solved continuous oscillation can be avoided by optimizing the insensitive zone And meanwhile inflation or exhaust control can be carried out according to the height change rate so that the time for the height of an air spring to enter a stable state can be further shortened the fluctuation amplitude in the height adjusting process of the air spring is reduced a better adjusting effect is obtained and the riding comfort of passengers is improved
