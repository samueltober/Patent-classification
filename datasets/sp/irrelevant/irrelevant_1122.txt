 CNU The utility model relates to a lightweight thrust rod spherical hinge assembly in an air suspension system which comprises a mandrel an elastic material and an outer pipe the mandrel is made of analuminumbased material and the mandrel the elastic material and the outer pipe are vulcanized into a whole which is sequentially connected in series in the radial direction The utility model discloses a lightweight thrust rod spherical hinge assembly in an air suspension system An iron spherical hinge mandrel in the spherical hinge assembly is changed into an aluminum alloy material the massof the whole spherical hinge assembly can be reduced by  compared with a traditional assembling mode when the lightweight thrust rod spherical hinge assembly is assembled to the thrust rod ballbearing pedestal only the outer pipe made of iron sulfide on the periphery of the spherical hinge needs to be in interference fit with the thrust rod ball bearing pedestal the machining efficiency of the ball bearing pedestal is improved and meanwhile the step that the spherical hinge assembly is assembled to the thrust rod ball bearing pedestal is omitted
