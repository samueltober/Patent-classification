 DEA Chassis component  in particular wheel carrier for fastening a bearing component  to a vehicle  whereby a wheel of a vehicle can be mounted on the chassis component  so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation R by means of the bearing component  Bearing component  has at least one first contact surface  on the bearing component side which extends essentially along a direction predetermined by the axis of rotation R and the chassis component has a second contact surface  on the chassis component side which extends substantially along a direction defined by the axis of rotation R R extends predetermined direction characterized in that the second contact surface  is designed such that the first contact surface  and the second contact surface  in particular by forming a press fit between the bearing component  and the Chassis component  in the assembled state cooperate in a forcelocking manner at least in the direction of the axis of rotation R
