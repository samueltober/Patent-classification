 CNA The invention provides a balance arm suspension and a chassis with the balance arm suspension The balance arm suspension comprises a balance arm used for adapting to terrain obstacles and adjusting the height of wheels and the wheels used for independent driving wherein the two ends of the balance arm are connected with the wheels respectively When an impact force is generated on a terrain obstacle or an uneven road surface the balance arm can balance the stress of the wheels to prevent a single wheel from generating a large load and the posture of the suspension is changed under the adjustment of the balance arm so that each wheel can touch the ground and the situations that parts of the wheels are stressed and the other wheels are suspended are avoided and the movement freedom degree of the balance arm suspension can be prevented from being limited by terrain obstacles and the balance arm suspension can adapt to complex terrain environments with many obstacles
