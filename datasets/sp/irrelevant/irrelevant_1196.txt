 CNU A suspension device relates to the field of automobile parts and comprises a connecting plate Wherein the two sets of connecting rod mechanisms the two sets of damping mechanisms the two half shafts the four end covers the four transition blocks the two fixing blocks and the two connecting shafts are symmetrically distributed with the center shaft of the connecting plate as the symmetry axis The upper and lower ends of the link mechanism are fixedly connected with the lower surface of the connecting plate and the wheel inner side one end of the half shaft is connected with the rim inner side center the other end of the half shaft is sleeved and fixed on a connecting shaft through a bearing transition blocks are respectively fixed at two ends of the connecting shaft and an end cover is arranged outside each transition block the transition block front end side is fixed with the fixed block side the upper end of the fixed block is fixed on the lower surface of the connectingplate the upper end and the lower end of the damping mechanism are fixed to the connecting plate and the fixing block respectively The damping mechanism can quickly enhance the adhesive force between the wheels and the ground reduce the dynamic load of the automobile body part and enable the automobile to run stably The connecting rod mechanism is used for transmitting force and torque and cancontrol the motion trails of the wheels in the running process of the automobile
