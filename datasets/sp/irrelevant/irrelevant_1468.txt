 CNA The invention discloses an independent vehicle suspension The independent vehicle suspension mainly comprises a mounting plate component a damping component and a swing arm component and the suspensions on the two sides of a vehicle are not connected or interfered with each other and are different from torsion beam suspensions and bridge type suspensions The independent vehicle suspensions aremainly used for vehicles driven by lowspeed light front wheels serve as rear wheel supports can be used in multiple rows and increase the bearing capacity of the vehicle and each independent vehicle suspension is mainly characterized in that wheel axles can be positioned at the upper part of a frame bottom beam so that the problem that transfer vehicles with ground clearances of less than  mm cannot be manufactured by the conventional bridge type suspension is solved Compared with the bridge type suspensions the suspensions are lower in cost better in damping effect and excellentin trafficability and are particularly suitable for forking vehicles and largemass object transfer vehicles in factory workshops
