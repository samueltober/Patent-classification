 CNU A shock absorption wheel assembly for an AGV and a doubledrive wheel set comprise a servo motor a speed reducer wheels a chain gear assembly and a shock absorption buffer assembly a power deviceprovides rotating power for a chain and chain wheel assembly to drive the wheels to rotate and the wheels the power assembly and the like are fixed to a frame through the shock absorption buffer assembly the damping wheel assembly is simple in structure each wheel is controlled by an independent power device and the power device can perform upanddown buffer motion along with the wheel simultaneously on a bumpy road section the damping and buffering assemblies can prevent vibration force from being transmitted to the trolley body while the wheels jolt and vibrate up and down so that the running stability of the trolley is guaranteed jolt and vibration can be restrained in the vertical direction through the design of double linear bearings and double damping springs in the dampingand buffering assemblies and the damping effect is optimized according to the doubledrive wheel set adopting the damping structure assembly through the reverse cross design of the wheel assembliesat the two ends the overall structure building compactness is improved the space utilization rate is optimized meanwhile steering of a trolley is more flexible and the running precision is improved
