 CNA The invention discloses a unified control method for alternatingcurrent lowvoltage ridethrough and gridconnected to offgrid conversion which is suitable for a modular multilevel converter for apower distribution network When a converter detects that the alternatingcurrent voltage provided for the alternatingcurrent load drops during gridconnected operation the alternatingcurrent powergrid is determined to break down the rated active power of the converter is injected into an alternatingcurrent system and recovery of the alternatingcurrent power grid is supported when the alternatingcurrent voltage is detected to be recovered the converter is switched to an alternatingcurrent droop control mode and then if a relay protection action instruction is received the converter keeps running in the alternatingcurrent droop control mode and if the relay protection action instruction is not received the converter is switched to a normal gridconnected operation mode Themethod has the functions of lowvoltage ride through and gridconnected to offgrid conversion and can perform unified processing on nonopencircuit faults and opencircuit faults of the alternatingcurrent power grid The converter can carry out effective power support on a temporary nonopencircuit fault help the system recover rapidly and carry out rapid gridconnectedtooffgrid switching on the opencircuit fault thereby realizing continuous power supply of a load
