 CNA The invention provides a faulttolerant control system for a transverse semiactive suspension of a highspeed train The faulttolerant control system comprises an acquisition module a fault detection module and a faulttolerant control module which are connected in sequence wherein the fault detection module detects whether a suspension system breaks down or not in real time and the faulttolerant control module controls a magnetorheological damper to output torque meeting the requirement for stable operation of the highspeed train according to a sliding mode variable structure algorithm and controls the magnetorheological damper to adjust output to maintain dynamic balance
