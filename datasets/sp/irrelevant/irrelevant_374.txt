 DEB     The invention relates to a wheel suspension  for a vehicle having a bearing unit  on which a vehicle wheel can be rotatably mounted a carrier  on which the bearing unit  rotates about a substantially vertical steering axis of rotation  is mounted a damper  which has a cylinder  connected nonrotatably to the carrier  a piston arranged displaceably in the cylinder  and a piston rod  connected to the piston and at least one bearing element  via which the piston rod  can be connected to a vehicle body In order to provide a lighterweight wheel suspension  for a vehicle that can be produced more costeffectively at least one antirotation lock is arranged between the cylinder  on the one hand and the piston and  or the piston rod  on the other hand rotation about its central longitudinal axis  relative to the piston or the piston rod  is secured the bearing element  being designed in such a way that that the piston rod  can be connected nonrotatably to the vehicle body via the bearing element
