 JPA To provide the technique of reducing the number of man hours while suppressing variations in coating qualitySOLUTION The method for manufacturing the bearing device  for vehicle that includes an outer ring member  an inner shaft member  and a plurality of balls  arranged between the outer ring member  and the inner shaft member  and has a cylindrical spigot part  that is provided on one end in the axial direction of the inner shaft member  so as to project to a recess in an axial direction and is inserted to a central hole w of a wheel W includes a step of closely arranging a coating nozzle  for spraying a coating material to a coating object surface  in an outer peripheral surface a of the spigot part  and a step of injecting air to a side face b adjacent to the coating object surface  while spraying and coating the coating material from the coating nozzle  to the coating object surface  while rotating the inner shaft member  around an axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
