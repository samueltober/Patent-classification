 CNU A damping swing arm comprises a swing arm body the edges of the two sides of the swing arm body are bent in the same direction for the first time to form first edge reinforcing walls the first edgereinforcing walls on the two sides are bent outwards for the second time to form second edge reinforcing walls and the second edge reinforcing walls are bent outwards for the third time to form edgebosses The shock absorption swing arm comprises the first edge reinforcing wall the second edge reinforcing wall and the edge boss the bending resistance and the tensile strength of the swing arm can be enhanced the good load impact bearing capacity is achieved and therefore the swing arm is not prone to breakage when bumping for a long time or being impacted by loads the sunken points and the clamping groove areas can provide convenience for positioning during machining in the mold design and machining process the bolt fixing holes in the junction positions of the first edge reinforcing wall and the second edge reinforcing wall can be connected with other automobile parts or the swing arm body is directly connected to an automobile frame
