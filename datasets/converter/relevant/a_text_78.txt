 CNA     The invention is a balanced modulation method suitable for cascaded Hbridge multilevel inverters and belongs to the technical field of multilevel converter PWM This method is based on twice the triangular carrier period which makes the triangular carrier cycle cycle between different carrier layers and compares with the sinusoidal modulation wave to generate an optimized pulse signal The method of the present invention can not only realize the power balance control of the connected units at all levels keep the DC side power supply discharge consistent thereby improving the output voltage quality of the inverter it can also reduce the time required for power balance at the same time it can also have the optimal line voltage Harmonic elimination performance In addition the method can be extended to n cascade units thereby improving the practicability of the inverter
