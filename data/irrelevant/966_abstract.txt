The present invention discloses a multihop question answering method and model of knowledge graph based on cognitive reasoning The method includes step  randomly selecting multiple batches of data from a given questionanswer pair data as a training set step  Take the training set as input train the parameters of the deep cognitive inference network model and use the neural network optimizer to minimize the value of the loss function during the training process to optimize the deep cognitive inference network model to obtain the optimized Network model Step  Process the questions in the test set through the optimized network model and score each candidate answer entity The candidate answer entity with the highest score is the answer to a given natural language question By simulating the human cognitive reasoning mechanism the hierarchical network model performs knowledge reasoning from different angles effectively using and modeling the nodelevel and edgelevel information in the knowledge graph and achieving significant performance for the knowledge graph multihop question and answer promote
