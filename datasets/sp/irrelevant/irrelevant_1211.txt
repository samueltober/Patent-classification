 KRB The present invention relates to a compact type front wheel insulator which comprises a main plate in which a plurality of insertion holes are formed in a circumferential direction a vehicle body coupler which is inserted into the insertion holes of the main plate a bearing plate for strut bearing an elastic outer skin which has an assembly of the main plate and the vehicle body coupler arranged at an upper portion and has the bearing plate arranged at a lower portion for integration through vulcanization wherein a mounting unit is formed at the central portion thereof an upper cup inserted into the upper portion of the mounting unit of the elastic outer skin and a lower cup inserted into the lower portion of the mounting unit of the elastic outer skin Therefore according to the present invention the main plate the vehicle body coupler and the bearing plate undergo vulcanization to form the elastic outer skin to be integrated Consequently because the coupler and the bearing plate undergo vulcanization to be integrated and form the elastic outer skin the performance of the present invention can be maintained at the same level as that of a threepoint dual path type In addition the bulk of the insulator can be reduced in comparison with the threepoint dual path type to thereby provide a lightweight product and reduce fabrication costs
