The utility model provides an energy storage device and an energy storage system for a microgrid which are characterized in that on the basis of a super capacitor bank a front energy storage battery pack and a motor generator cascade motor set are also adopted for electric quantity transfer and when the energy storage device operates the energy storage device can be used for energy storage The method comprises the following steps rapidly extracting electric energy from a power supply module through a super capacitor bank starting a motor generator cascade motor set through a front energy storage battery and charging the rear energy storage battery set by lifting charging voltage through the motor generator cascade motor set Compared with a mode of directly charging the rear energy storage battery pack through the super capacitor bank the energy storage mode is higher in charging voltage and continuous in charging process so that the energy storage speed can be greatly improved
