 KRA An objective of the present invention is to provide an ecofriendly vehicle of a new shape which resolves the problem of a technological limit of a conventional electric vehicle that the vehicle can be continuously driven only when an exclusive charging location or an external electric power for charging exists thereby enabling longdistance driving without requiring an additional infrastructure for charging To this end an electric vehicle capable of selfcharging of the present invention comprises a power generating wheel  having a power generating device installed at the rear wheel of a frontwheel drive electric vehicle disclosed in the prior art to charge a charging storage battery installed at a vehicle body with electricity produced during driving an output voltage control device  of the power generating wheel which controls the output state of the charging electricity to convert electricity produced by the power generating wheel into a shape suitable for charging the charging storage battery a storage battery crosscharging device  having a storage battery set individually constructed for charging or driving provided at the electric vehicle during charging such that when the electricity of the driving storage battery is nearly consumed during driving the driving storage battery may be replaced with the charging storage battery which was being charged and a technology to perform selfcharging when the electric vehicle is stopped and mounted on a virtual road driving machine which is devised by the present applicant
