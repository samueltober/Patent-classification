 CNB The invention discloses a system and a method for reporting the power outage The networking of a master node and a slave node based on a power line carrier and a micropower wireless dualmode communication method is carried out and a reliable dualmode heterogeneous hybrid networking mechanism is provided for the problem that the power outage reporting of an electric energy meter user is not stable in an electricity utilization information acquisition system so that the reliability of a power outage reporting function is guaranteed The system and the method for reporting the power outageadopt the dualmode heterogeneous hybrid networking mechanism have a multipath multiselection function and do not rely on a certain path the system and the method can carry out the heterogeneousnetworking between a power line and a wireless channel and have characteristics of realtime and dynamic networking so that the path switches to an alternative path for performing the communicationimmediately after failure of the communication the problems of abnormal alarm and missing reporting of the power outage of the electric energy meter user in the electricity utilization information acquisition system are effectively solved the precise positioning of the user and the alarm prompting are realized once the power outage occurs and the situation for performing a passive rushrepair on a user power outage failure in the past is changed therefore the passive rushrepair changes into an active rushrepair the rushrepair efficiency is improved and the quality of service is improved
