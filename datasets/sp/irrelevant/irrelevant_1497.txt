 CNU An aluminum straight reaction rod assembly comprises an aluminum connecting rod aluminum straight connectors are connected to the two ends of the aluminum connecting rod steel sleeves are embedded in holes of the aluminum straight connectors the steel sleeves and the inner surfaces of the holes of the aluminum straight connectors are integrally extruded in a oneoff mode through hot extrusionand rubber connector assemblies are fixed in the holes of the aluminum straight connectors through elastic check rings The rubber joint assembly is provided with an aluminum pin shaft and a circle of rubber is wrapped outside the aluminum pin shaft A transverse rod is fixed to the middle of the aluminum connecting rod the transverse rod is transversely fixed to the middle of the aluminum connecting rod and is perpendicular to a center shaft of the aluminum connecting rod the length of the transverse rod is equal to the width of the aluminum connecting rod and the transverse rod and the aluminum connecting rod body are integrally formed through hot extrusion By the adoption of the structure the weight of the assembly is reduced meanwhile the using function and function of the assembly are not affected the bearing capacity the bending resistance and the torsion resistance of the product are improved enough strength and stability are achieved and the lightweight requirementof an automobile is met
