 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of robots in particular to a mobile chassis of an inspection robot and aims to solve the problems that the gravity center of the robot is high and the chassis is unstable due to the fact that the lower layer is a walking chassis and the upper layer needs to be provided with a lifting mechanism when more inspection robot mounting equipment is available on the market at present The disc body is provided with the four large round holes the driven wheel is fixed on the driven wheel support through the four large round holes the driven wheel support is fixed on the upper side of the chassis the driving wheel is directly connected with the motor in the middle of the disc body the motor support is fixed with the swing arm the swing arm is fixed on the bearing seat and the bearing seat is fixed on the upper side of the disc body The driving module and the driven wheel are both fixed on the upper side of the chassis so that the gravitycenter of the mobile chassis is reduced and particularly the inspection robot walks more stably due to the design of the lowgravitycenter mobile chassis with more mounted equipment and larger mass
