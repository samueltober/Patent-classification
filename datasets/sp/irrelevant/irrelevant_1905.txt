 CNA     A shock absorber interconnected body stabilization mechanism belongs to the technical field of vehicle suspension The invention includes a plurality of shock absorbers arranged between the frame and the suspension The shock absorber includes a piston assembly an external damping valve an air chamber an air chamber damping valve and a floating piston one end of the external damping valve and the piston The rod oil chamber of the assembly is connected and the air chamber is connected to the rodless oil chamber of the piston assembly The air chamber damping valve is located at the end of the air chamber communicating with the rodless oil chamber The floating piston is slidingly connected to the inner wall of the air chamber and the air chamber is far away from the air chamber damping A highpressure gas is provided between one end of the valve and the floating piston the frame and the suspension are respectively connected to the fixed end and the telescopic end of the piston assembly and the external damping valves and rodless oil chambers of the two coaxial shock absorbers are crossconnected The external damping valves of multiple shock absorbers on the same side of the vehicle communicate with each other and the rodless oil chambers of multiple shock absorbers on the same side of the vehicle communicate with each other The invention can effectively take into account the antiroll performance of the vehicle and the effective driving force on the torsion road surface
