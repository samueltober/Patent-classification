A DC power supply system for a kV smart energy station comprises an AC microgrid V bus and a DC microgrid V bus which are connected through an ACDC converter I The AC microgrid Vbus supplies power to the DC V bus for the station through an ACDC converter II and the DC microgrid V bus supplies power to the DC V bus for the station through a DCDC converter I to serve as standby power Suppression or conduction is realized through the difference value of the direct current voltage of the output end the AC microgrid V bus is provided with an AC feeder cabinet and MWlevel lithium iron phosphate energy storage and the DC microgrid V bus is provided with a super capacitor I The reusable MW lithium iron phosphate peak regulation energy storage system cancels a leadacid storage battery for a station cancels a conventional UPS power supply and configures a smallcapacity super capacitor to stabilize the voltage of a directcurrent bus for the station thereby improving the reliability and stability of the whole system reducing land occupation saving investment reducing the workload of operation and maintenance and being more friendly tothe environment And the advantages of multistation fusion are brought into full play
