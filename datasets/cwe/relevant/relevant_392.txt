 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device which can homogenize the expansion of an outer ring in a radial direction caused by the pressureinsertion of a sensor holderSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  has an outer ring  having a vehicle body attachment flange e including bolt holes inserted with bolts for attaching the attachment flange to a vehicle body and also having an innerside fitting part a of a sensor holder  at an innerside opening part a hub ring  at least one inner ring  pressureinserted into the hub ring  doublerow rolling bodies and the sensor holder  The vehicle body attachment flange e includes the four bolt holes g which adjoin one another with a reference line B orthogonal to a center shaft sandwiched among them a linear line passing a center of one bolt hole out of the bolt holes adjoining one another with the reference line B sandwiched among them and a center of a pitch circle and a linear line passing a center of the other bolt hole and the center of the pitch circle are arranged so as to form an acute angle and in the sensor holder  a rib e is formed between the adjacent bolt holes g which adjoin each other with the reference line B sandwiched therebetween in a view in an axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
