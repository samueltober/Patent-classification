The invention discloses a switching power converter controlled by a control signal with a variable ontime The control circuit is configured to sense the AC input voltage of the power factor correction PFC power supply circuit in the switching power converter provide at least one power switch of the PFC power supply circuit with a control signal having an ontime and an offtime and respond To detect the peak voltage of the AC input voltage based on the AC input voltage sensed during the interval starting from the peak voltage of the AC input voltage and ending at the next zero crossing after the peak voltage of the AC input voltage increase the turnon of the control signal Time to improve the power factor of the switching power converter Other exemplary switching power converters PFC power supply circuits and control circuits for controlling one or more power switches are also disclosed
