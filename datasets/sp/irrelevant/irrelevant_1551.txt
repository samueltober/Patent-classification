 CNU The utility model relates to a dragging arm for a mountain offroad vehicle which solves the problem of poor stability of the dragging arm caused by low bearing strength of the dragging arm with an integrated structure under the condition that the vehicle body shakes greatly in the prior art A dragging arm for a mountain offroad vehicle comprises a lining part and a steering knuckle connectingpart and further comprises a reinforcing arm which is detachably installed between the lining part and the steering knuckle connecting part The dragging arm is formed by respectively mounting the lining part and the steering knuckle connecting part at the two ends of the reinforcing arm by means of the combined dragging arm design when the dragging arm is stressed force at the two ends of thedragging arm is transmitted to the reinforcing arm and is dispersed and consumed by the reinforcing arm the bearing strength and stability of the dragging arm are improved meanwhile the machiningcost of the dragging arm is high and if the two ends of the dragging arm are accidentally damaged the connection between the lining part and the steering knuckle connecting part is unstable Duringreplacement the reinforcing arm can be retained so that the replacement cost of the dragging arm is reduced and the usability of the dragging arm is improved
