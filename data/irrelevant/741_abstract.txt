The invention provides a traction converter system The system is used for carrying out electric energy conversion on original multiphase alternating current received from an external power grid so as to supply target alternating current to a traction motor The traction converter system is mainly composed of building block type units a switch cabinet and a centralized control device and each building block type converter unit receives original multiphase alternating current and conducts electric energy conversion on the original multiphase alternating current so that the building blocktype converter units can output multiple sets of alternating current with different phases According to the current level andor the voltage level of the target alternating current the traction converter system is selectively switched to a parallel connection mode or a series connection mode through a switch cabinet and a centralized control device In a parallel connection mode the singlephase alternating current in each set is output to a singlephase stator winding of the traction motor in parallel so as to provide large current needed by the target alternating current and in a seriesmode the singlephase alternating current in each group is output to a singlephase stator winding of the traction motor in series so as to provide a large voltage required by the target alternatingcurrent
