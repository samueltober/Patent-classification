The invention discloses a method and a device for constructing a steadystate fluid energy power generation device It captures energy from the nonsteadystate fluid kinetic energy of renewable energy and converts it into stable rotational kinetic energy and converts the stable rotational kinetic energy While converting into stable electrical energy the energy concentrator internal generator external energy spill generator motor speed control and speed stabilization magnetic power and Lorenz power system and the steadystate flow energy power generation device are integrated into many A set of structures and parts with the same function and purpose are reserved for common use and the rest are deleted so as to reduce the moment of inertia of the impeller and generator rotor improve its fretting stability power generation efficiency and increase power generation The structure is simplified the cost is reduced and all the functions that a steadystate flow energy power generation device should have are also realized The steadystate flow energy power generation device uses the variable moment of inertia technology in the rotation of the machine to enhance the load capacity of the steadystate flow energy power generation device The composition of the steadystate flow energy power generation device expresses the composition method of the steadystate flow energy power generation device
