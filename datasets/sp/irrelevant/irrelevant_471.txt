 CNA The invention discloses a nonlinear active suspension faulttolerant tracking control method based on a proportional integral observer The method comprises the steps that firstly a half vehicle suspension model based on a TakagiSugeno TS fuzzy model is built for describing the uncertainty of a model of a suspension system secondly on the basis of the model a robust H infinite output feedback controller is developed for enhancing the performance of a suspension in the normal actuator mode and the output response of the controller is regarded as an ideal reference trajectory finallythe proportional integral observer is designed for online and accurate estimation of actuator faults and an active tolerant tracking controller is further designed for compensating for performance loss caused by the actuator faults the method is used for nonlinear active suspension control over the actuator faults and the problem that external uncertain interference and actuator faults cannot be dealt with is solved
