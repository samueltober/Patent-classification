 CNA     The invention relates to a topological structure of a mediumvoltage directmounted photovoltaic power generation system which includes a plurality of power modules The power module is composed of a photovoltaic module a highfrequency isolation DCDC converter module and a DCAC converter module  And multiple power modules are connected in parallel to form an overall topology structure through a cascaded Hbridge structure The power modules are all designed independently the input side of the power module is not connected to a common DC bus and the output side adopts a series structure The highfrequency isolation DCDC converter is adopted in the topological structure of the present invention to reduce the volume and weight of the whole machine and reduce the cost the cascaded Hbridge topology is adopted to reduce the number of power electronic devices which facilitates the realization of redundant design and seamless switching of redundant The remaining modes can improve the safety and stability of system operation the use of virtual synchronous motor control can provide voltage and frequency support to the grid increase system inertia and damping and can more stably support the safe and stable operation of the power network
