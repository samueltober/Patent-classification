Architecture and design techniques for a single inductor multipleoutput SIMO DCDC converter are presented The SIMO DCDC converter is based on orderedpowerdistributivecontrol OPDC scheme with several novel control mechanism to optimize the performance of the power delivery capability conversion efficiency and voltage ripple In addition to buck mode outputs the new SIMO DCDC converter can also have an output channel operating at autobuckboost mode for the input voltage varying with the usage time
