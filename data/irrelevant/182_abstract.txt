The invention discloses a radio frequency power amplifier capable of cancelling distortion signals by adaptive feedback and a cancelling method wherein the radio frequency power amplifier comprisesan input power divider A a directional coupler A a cancelled radio frequency power amplifier A a distortion main signal coupler A a signal canceling coupler A a power divider A and other devices In the scheme provided by the invention a cancelled radio frequency power amplifier output signal can be subjected to extraction of a main signal and a distortion signal through coupling andthen the radio frequency power amplifier output signal is combined with an input source signal thus the main signal is canceled the kept distortion signal is coupled to a canceled amplification unit input end after being amplified by the canceled amplification unit amplitude of the distortion signal is equal to the amplitude of an own output end distortion signal phase of the distortion signal is reverse to the phase of the own output end distortion signal and after amplification effects of cancelling and linearity improvement are realized at the output end of the cancelled amplification unit
