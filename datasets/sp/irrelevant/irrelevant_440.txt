 CNB The invention discloses a oneway rotary power generation device for recovery of vibration energy of a vehicle suspension and belongs to the field of energy recovery According to the oneway rotarypower generation device through a designed contact structure and a designed bearing plate structure random reciprocating linear motion of a damping cylinder piston can be subtly converted into oneway rotation motion of a synchronous belt oneway lowspeed rotation of a belt wheel is turned into oneway highspeed rotation of a pinion then the pinion transmits highspeed rotation to a power generator and thus oneway rotary power generation for recovery of the vibration energy of the vehicle suspension is achieved Therefore oneway rotary power generation for recovery of the vibration energy of the vehicle suspension can be achieved and the energy recovery efficiency is effectively improved and parts used by the oneway rotary power generation device are mostly standard parts andreplaceability is good
