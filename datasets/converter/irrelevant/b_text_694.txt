 CNA     The auxiliary tank and efficiency tank of the DCDC power converter are cascaded together to share inductors capacitors and transformers At startup the switching transistor pumps the auxiliary tank to increase the current Gradually reduce the switching frequency and sense the voltage gain and power of the converter until the voltage gain matches the voltage gain calculated for the efficiency tank Then tank switching occurs and the transistors of the efficiency tank are pumped at the last switching frequency used by the auxiliary tank and the auxiliary tank is not pumped Since the voltage gains before and after the slot switching are equal there will be no output voltage deviation or current spikes In the event of a voltage dip or failure it will switch back to the auxiliary tank at the switching frequency determined by the dynamic contour line where the voltage gains of the two tanks under the current power state are equal
