 CNB An independent suspension mechanism and steering mechanism capable of realizing erectly bouncing of front wheels of a motor vehicle belongs to the technical field of the chassis of fourwheeled vehicles or vehicles with more than four wheels and solves the technical problems that when fourwheeled vehicles or vehicles with more than four wheels are in independent suspension conditions the frontwheels cannot erectly bounce or bouncing changes the initial erect state The technical problems are solved which is beneficial to increasing the bouncing amplitude of the wheels increasing the relative load improving the stability of driving and the like A steering mechanism is specially arranged for the suspension The key technical point is that the independent suspension mechanism and steering mechanism mainly consists of a vehicle body frame a front axle mechanism that can erectly bounce the steering mechanism a parallel four shaft lever type auxiliary shock absorbing mechanism andthe like The vehicle body frame is used for erecting a vehicle body The steering mechanism mainly consists of a steering wheel a steering gear box a ball head a longitudinal pull rod a transverse pull rod a Vshaped vertical rod connecting body and the like The parallel four shaft lever type auxiliary shock absorbing mechanism mainly consists of a front upperlower shaft lever a rear upperlower shaft lever shaft lever jackets a front extension shaft a rear extension shaft two front shock absorbers two rear shock absorbers bearing jackets and the like
