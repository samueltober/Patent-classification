The present invention discloses a modular multilevel converter loss optimization control method based on circulating current injection The method includes the following steps using the modular multilevel converter active power and reactive power to obtain the AC side current using the modular multilevel converter Power conservation obtains the DC side current within the range of the amplitude and phase angle of the injected secondary circulation and the fourth circulation use the bridge arm current to calculate the total loss of the modular multilevel converter submodule and calculate the result Construct the submodule total loss data set find the amplitude and phase angle of the secondary circulation and the fourth circulation corresponding to the smallest total loss value in the data set and inject the optimal secondary circulation and the fourth circulation into the modular multielectricity at the same time In the threephase bridge arm of the flat converter the loss reduction of the modular multilevel converter is realized The invention realizes the reduction of the loss of the modular multilevel converter does not need to increase the construction cost of the modular multilevel converter compared with the conventional method and does not affect the output power quality of the modular multilevel converter
