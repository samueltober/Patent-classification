 CNB The present invention provides a modular cascaded multilevel converter and a module switching method and a controller thereof When power information corresponds to an efficiency rise interval of a power efficiency relationship curve the modular cascaded multilevel converter is controlled to operate in a minimummodule input mode that satisfies output voltage requirements so that each module isoperated at higher power An operating point of the modular cascaded multilevel converter is moved to a direction of efficiency increase thereby realizing the improvement of the conversion efficiency of the modular cascaded multilevel converter When the power information corresponds to an efficiency decline interval of the power efficiency relationship curve the modular cascaded multilevel converter is controlled to operate in an allmodule input mode so that each module is operated at lower power The operating point of the modular cascaded multilevel converter is moved to a direction opposite to efficiency decline thereby realizing the improvement of the conversion efficiency of the modular cascaded multilevel converter
