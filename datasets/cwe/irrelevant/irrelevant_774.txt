 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a hub unit seal structure for an industrial vehicle in which a bush fixed to an axle housing can be easily removed by press fitting    An axle housing  is formed on an outer peripheral surface of a bearing on which a bearing is mounted and inside the outer peripheral surface of the bearing in the axial direction and has a diameter larger than that of the outer peripheral surface of the bearing and a bush  is pressfitted It is formed between the outer peripheral surface of the bush the first stepped surface formed inside the outer peripheral surface of the bush in the axial direction and extending radially outward from the outer peripheral surface of the bush and between the outer peripheral surface of the bearing and the outer peripheral surface of the bush The length of the bush  in the axial direction is set to be smaller than the distance between the first step surface and the second step surface and is inside the bush  in the axial direction There was a gap G between the inner end surface and the first stepped surface
