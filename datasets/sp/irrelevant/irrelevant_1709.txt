 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of sanitation vehicle chassis and discloses an unmanned pure electric sanitation vehicle chassis which comprises a chassis body a vehicle head is fixedly connected to one end of the chassis body and a driving cabin is arranged in the vehicle head According to the unmanned pure electric sanitation vehicle chassis by arranging a long plate spring a short plate spring a middle axle motor and auxiliary wheels when the load capacity of an electric sanitation vehicle is too large during operation the long plate spring bends to lower the chassis due to the facts that the arm of force of the long plate spring is longer the long plate spring shares a larger bearing surface and the bending effect of the long plate spring is better than that of the short plate spring the radius of the auxiliary wheels is smaller than that of a driving wheel the elevation of the lowest point of the long plate spring is the same with that of the lowest point of the short plate spring and the surfaces of the auxiliary wheels can be attached to the ground when the vehicle body sinks and due to the bending effect of the auxiliary wheels is lower than that of the long plate spring the auxiliary wheels can support the vehicle and share the weight of the vehicle
