 CNU The utility model relates to a crawler selfpropelled mechanical chassis wheel structure The crawler selfpropelled mechanical chassis wheel structure is characterized by comprising a hub module anda flexible wearresistant layer the flexible wearresistant layer is arranged on the outer contour of the hub module according to the utility model the polymer material layer made of the polyurethane material is compounded on the original structure of the hub unit through the characteristics of excellent wear resistance hardness controllability and flexibility of the polyurethane material the crawler belt and the bearing are protected so that the service life of the crawler belt is prolonged the service time of the bearing is prolonged the frequency of manually replacing the crawler belt and the bearing wheel is reduced and the production efficiency is greatly improved due to the fact that the clamping groove structure of the flexible abrasionresistant layer is formed in the outer contour of the hub unit limiting of the flexible abrasionresistant layer is achieved in the radial direction The axial displacement of the flexible wearresisting layer is limited by arrangingan axis limiting connecting structure at the bottom of the flexible wearresisting layer clamping groove and the reliability of assembly connection between the hub unit and the flexible wearresisting layer is guaranteed
