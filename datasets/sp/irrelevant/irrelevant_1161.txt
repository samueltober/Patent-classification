 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of robots in particular to a robot damping device and a wheel set structure with the same The damping device comprises an adjustable structure and a plurality of damping mechanisms The elasticity range can be adjusted according to a robot inspection environment impact force borne by a wheel set structure can be buffered absorbed and digested in a segmented and stepbystep mode the whole buffering and damping process is more stable impact and vibration of the wheel set structure from the ground are absorbed and buffered more effectively stable operation of the robot body is guaranteed and structural damage to all circuit components in the robot body is effectively reduced An upper fork arm a lower fork arm and the damping device forma doubleforkarm structure the weight of a robot body can be effectively shared impact force from the ground on the wheel set structure is relieved and the suspended wheel set structure can more flexibly carry a robot body to conduct inspection work in various complex and severe environments such as pits and soil slopes
