 USA A vehicle powertrain proactive damping system includes a plurality of proactive damping structures mounted on a powertrain structure with each proactive damping structure includes a magneto rheological elastomer MRE An electromagnet is associated with each proactive damping structure A control unit includes a processor circuit A sensor obtains vibration data regarding the powertrain structure A LIDAR sensor is mounted on the vehicle and is electrically connected with the control unit The LIDAR sensor provides data to the control unit indicative of upcoming road surface conditions to be experienced by the vehicle Based on data from at the sensor and the LIDAR sensor the processor circuit is constructed and arranged to control voltage to the electromagnets to selectively adjust a rigidity of the associated proactive damping structure so as to control vibrational effects on the powertrain structure
