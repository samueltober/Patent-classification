 CNU The utility model discloses a wearresistant friction wheel for a pouring ferry vehicle which comprises a friction wheel outer ring support plates are fixedly connected to the periphery of the innerwall of the friction wheel outer ring and friction wheel inner rings are fixedly connected to the inner sides of the support plates According to the utility model the wearresistant layer is arranged a user can conveniently improve the wearresisting effect of the outer ring of the friction wheel the abrasion speed of external factors on the outer ring of the friction wheel is reduced therefore the service life of the outer ring of the friction wheel is prolonged the damping mechanism is matched with the fixed column the outer ring of the friction wheel is stressed therefore forceacts on the inner ring of the friction wheel at the moment the inner ring of the friction wheel extrudes the fixed column at the moment the fixed column extrudes the movable plate the spring is stressed the fixed column is damped through elastic resilience of the spring deformation of the outer ring of the friction wheel due to the fact that objects are too heavy is prevented and the problems that a friction wheel for a traditional pouring ferry vehicle is poor in wearresisting effect and damping effect are solved
