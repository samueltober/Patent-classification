 CNU     The utility model relates to a rear axle assembly structure with a variable wheel base comprising a cross beam a left longitudinal arm connected with the left end of the cross beam and a right longitudinal arm connected with the right end of the cross beam The left longitudinal arm and the right longitudinal arm have the same structure and The left and right longitudinal arms are symmetrical the small ends of the left and right longitudinal arms are respectively fixedly connected with a bushing with the same structure and the large ends of the left and right longitudinal arms are respectively connected to a brake assembly with the same structure Fixed connection characterized in that the left longitudinal arm and the right longitudinal arm are both variable crosssection circular tube structures which are formed by stamping and welding of the coiled tube and the length can be changed by changing the blanking die The utility model can increase the generalization rate of the rear axle assembly realize the sharing of molds shorten the research and development cycle and reduce the research and development cost
