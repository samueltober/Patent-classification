A safety and stability control method against automobile tire blowout which is used for manned and unmanned driving vehicles and based on vehicle braking driving steering and suspension systems The present method establishes tire blowout determination based on a tire pressure detection mode a status tire pressure mode and a steering mechanics state mode and uses a safety and stability control mode model and algorithm and control structure and process against automobile tire blowout On the basis of a tire blowout state point the vehicle braking driving steering steering wheel steering force and suspension balancing control are carried out in a coordinated manner by entering and exiting a tire blowout control state and switching between a normal mode and a tire blowout control mode so as to realize tire blowout control in which real or unreal tire blowout processes overlap In cases where a tire blowout process state and the motion states of the wheel and vehicle with a blown tire are changed rapidly the technical difficulties of the wheel and the vehicle being seriously unstable due to tire blowout and the extreme tire blowout state being difficult to control are overcome solving the safety technical problems associated with automobile tire blowout
