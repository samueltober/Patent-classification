 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To easily output a desired AC voltage to a load by suppressing a current impact from occurring in a switching configuration in which two modulation methods are appropriately switched and applied    SOLUTION In a power conversion system  switching is switched so as to output one of voltage level commands Lpwm and Lfp of a first modulation unit  by an asynchronous PWM method and a second modulation unit  by a fixed pulse pattern method The output unit  and the voltage level command L input from the switching output unit It is assumed that a signal generation unit  that generates a gate signal g based on the above is provided In the output of the switching output unit  the switching determination result for example frequency command fref modulation rate command of the switching determination unit  in which the switching frequency fc and the switching modulation rate dc that are the reference for switching of the switching output unit  are set in advance Switching judgment result obtained by comparing dref with switching frequency fc and switching modulation rate dc respectively Switch appropriately based on Sel
