 EPA The purpose of the present invention is to improve the driving stability of a vehicle in which a double wishbone type or multilink type suspension is adopted A double wishbone type suspension  has a sliding bearing  disposed between a coil spring  provided coaxially with a shock absorber  and an upper support  for mounting the coil spring  to the body of the vehicle along with the shock absorber  the sliding bearing  permitting the coil spring  and the upper support  to rotate relative to each other The sliding bearing  permits the coil spring  and the upper support  to rotate relative to each other with torque lower than torque generated by the torsion of the coil spring  caused by the load of the vehicle acting on a damper assembly
