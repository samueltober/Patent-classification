 CNA The invention discloses an allterrain suspension steering device which comprises a steering mechanism and a suspension mechanism The steering mechanism comprises a bogie a steering shaft a steering motor and front forks used for installing wheels The suspension mechanism comprises a rack a Yshaped upper cantilever a pair of lower cantilevers and a pair of damping springs and the two endsof each damping spring are hinged to the lower cantilever and the rack respectively The damping springs are obliquely arranged between the upper cantilever and the lower cantilever and when the steering mechanism is impacted by the ground the bogie swings under the constraint of the upper cantilever and the lower cantilevers so as to reduce the vibration amplitude of the rack According to theallterrain suspension steering device the automatic steering system and the suspension system are integrated and the problems that the structure is complex and not light enough due to the fact thatthe steering system and the suspension system are arranged separately and vibration fatigue of vehicle body parts is caused due to the fact that no damping system exists can be effectively solved
