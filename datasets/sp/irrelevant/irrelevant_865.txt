 CNU The utility model discloses a torsion bar spring a suspension system and an automobile and the torsion bar spring is used for the suspension system and comprises a lowrigidity torsion bar and a highrigidity torsion bar the highrigidity torsion bar comprises a first torsion bar part and a second torsion bar part a tooth groove is formed in the first end of the first torsion bar part teeth are arranged at the first end of the second torsion bar part and the teeth are arranged in the tooth groove The first torsion bar part and the second torsion bar part are both hollow bars the lowrigidity torsion bar is arranged in the first torsion bar part and the second torsion bar part and the two ends of the lowrigidity torsion bar are fixedly connected with the second end of the first torsion bar part and the second end of the second torsion bar part respectively The first end of the torsion rod spring is fixed to the first side of a lower cross arm of the suspension system and thesecond end of the torsion rod spring is rotatably connected to the vehicle body During use firstly the lowrigidity torsion bar deforms so that the riding comfort is good when the lowrigidity torsion bar is twisted and deformed to a certain degree the teeth of the second torsion bar part abut against the groove wall of the tooth groove of the first torsion bar part the rigidity of the whole suspension system is improved and the roll stability is improved
