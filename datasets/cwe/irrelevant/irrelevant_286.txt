 CNA The invention relates to a drive axle based on a halfshaft bearing novel installation system A brake assembly is arranged on a rear axle housing assembly in a sleeving manner and a half shaft assembly is mounted on the rear axle housing assembly The drive axle is characterized in that a half shaft is sleeved with a half shaft bearing a bearing bush is pressed on the outer side of the half shaft bearing an inner oil seal is arranged on the surface of the bearing bush a snap spring is arranged on the outer side of the bearing bush and fixed on the half shaft an oil seal bush is arrangedon one side of the half shaft bearing an outer oil seal is pressed on the inner diameter of the oil seal bush and a bearing baffle is arranged on one side of the outer oil seal and presses and fixesthe half shaft bearing through a brake assembly and an oil baffle disc is installed between the bearing baffle and the inner side end face of the half shaft and a brake drum is installed at the endof the half shaft through half shaft bolts The lightweight drive axle meets the design service life and the axial bearing capacity required by a whole vehicle meanwhile the hidden danger that a tapered roller bearing of the drive axle fails due to lack of lubricating grease is eradicated and the potential safety hazard that gear oil leaks into a brake under extreme conditions to cause failureof a brake system is eradicated
