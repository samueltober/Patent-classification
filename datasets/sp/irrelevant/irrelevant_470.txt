 CNA The invention discloses a suspension system a chassis and a vehicle The suspension system comprises a suspension guide mechanism a lever a vibration absorber and a driving mechanism When the suspension system works when the driving mechanism operates in the first direction a power output end of the driving mechanism pushes a driving end upwards a driven end pushes the vibration absorber tomove downwards the distance between a wheel hub and a frame is increased so that the distance between the frame and the ground is increased when the driving mechanism operates in the second direction the power output end of the driving mechanism pulls the driving end downwards the driven end drives the vibration absorber to move upwards wherein the first direction and the second direction are opposite the distance between the wheel hub and the frame is reduced so that the distance between the frame and the ground is reduced According to the suspension system the distance between theframe and the ground can be actively adjusted the suspension system can be adjusted according to different pavement conditions so that the applicability of the suspension system during passing different pavements is expanded
