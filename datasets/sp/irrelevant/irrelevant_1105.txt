 CNU The utility model provides a mounting fixture for a longitudinal composite material plate spring suspension Grooves are formed in the opposite sides between the plate spring supports And a rotatingrod is placed between the grooves the outer side of the rotating rod is wrapped with a rubber layer bearings are installed at the two ends of the rotating rod correspondingly a worm is welded to the bottoms of the bearings a worm wheel is connected to one side of the worm a bevel gear is welded to the bottom end of the worm wheel and a transmission rod is connected to one side of the bevel gear The mounting fixture for the longitudinallyarranged composite material plate spring suspension is provided with the rotating rod and the rotating rod can ascend and descend through matching ofthe worm wheel and the worm due to the fact that different plate spring suspensions have different radians the rotating rod has a heightadjustable function so as to meet the use requirements of theplate spring suspensions with different radians meanwhile the worm wheel and the worm are matched for use so as to have a selflocking function the rotating rod cannot fall off after rising to a certain height and meanwhile a rubber layer is additionally arranged so as to prevent the plate spring suspensions from sliding off
