 JPA To provide a sealing device which can be improved in muddy water resistanceSOLUTION A sealing device  comprises a slinger  having a first cylinder part  fit to an external peripheral face of a hub shaft  and fixed to the hub shaft  a circular plate part  extending to the outside in a radial direction along a side face of a flange part  from an end part of the first cylinder part  at a vehicle outerside and a second cylinder part  extending to a vehicle innerside from an external peripheral end part of the circular plate part  a core grid  fit to an end part of an outer ring  at the vehicle outerside and fixed to the outer ring  a seal lip  fixed to the core grid  and coming in slidecontact with the first cylinder part  and the circular plate part  and a cylindrical deflector  which is fixed to the core grid  and in which an external peripheral face is arranged opposite to an internal peripheral face of the second cylinder part  which therefore forms a labyrinth clearance S between the second cylinder part  and the deflector  An end face a of the second cylinder part  at the vehicle inner side is arranged on a plane flushed with an end face a of the deflector  at the vehicle inner sideSELECTED DRAWING Figure
