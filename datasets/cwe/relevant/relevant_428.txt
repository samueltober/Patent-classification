 CNU The utility model discloses a hub bearing locking structure Wherein the end part of the automobile half shaft is provided with a ball cage and the hub bearing is provided with an internal spline the selflocking limiting device further comprises a selflocking fixing piece used for fixing the ball cage a plurality of bent limiting pieces are arranged on the selflocking fixing piece every twoadjacent bent limiting pieces abut against each other to be limited and the bent positions of the bent limiting pieces are connected with internal splines on the hub bearing in a clamped mode The selflocking fixing piece with the bent limiting piece is used for locking the ball cage the overall rigidity of the locking structure is effectively improved cost is saved and installation is convenient and fast The locking effect in two degrees of freedom of tension resistance and torsion resistance is achieved by means of the material strength of the selflocking fixing piece the structureis simple and the effect is excellent meanwhile the hub bearing and the ball cage are in end face spline fit compared with a traditional axial spline fit mode the overall weight of the locking structure is reduced the driving torque of an automobile is improved and therefore the dynamic operation performance of the automobile is remarkably improved
