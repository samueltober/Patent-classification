 CNA The invention discloses a constantpressure support for an AGV automatic adjusting spring and a working method The constantpressure support comprises a bottom base wherein a servo motor is arrangedon one side of the bottom base an adjusting spring assembly is arranged on the other side of the bottom base the adjusting spring assembly is connected with a driving wheel through a driving wheelsupport and the adjusting spring assembly is used for adjusting the height of a trolley The rotating power of the servo motor is converted into the telescopic amount of the spring in the length direction so that the pretightening force of the spring can be changed along with the change of the pressure borne by the driving wheel and the problems that an existing AGV is not positioned on the same horizontal line and the shaking amplitude of the trolley is large are solved
