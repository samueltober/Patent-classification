A method for reducing the influence of surges in AC input voltage on UPS is disclosed Reduce the impact of surge in AC input voltage on UPS If the AC input voltage is overvoltage the DC bus target voltage will be used as the DC bus voltage to operate the rectifier unless the rectifier reaches its current limit If the rectifier reaches its current limit the DC bus target voltage is increased by a predetermined amount which is used as the current DC bus target voltage unless the increased DC bus target voltage exceeds the maximum DC bus voltage limit In this case the current DC The bus target voltage is set to the maximum DC bus voltage limit The current DC bus target voltage is then used to operate the rectifier until its current limit is reached or the AC input voltage surge has passed If the rectifier reaches its current limit again repeat the above steps starting with increasing the DC bus target voltage
