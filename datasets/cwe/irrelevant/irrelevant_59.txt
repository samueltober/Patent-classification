 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of unmanned vehicles in particular to a mounting structure of an encoder Wherein the differential axle assembly is installed in the middle of a frame and the transmission parts are symmetrically installed at the two ends of the differential axle assembly Wherein the transmission part comprises a transmission shaft and a rim mounting plate fixedly mounted at one end of the transmission shaft the other end of the transmission shaft is rotatably arranged in the differential axle assembly a wheel assembly is mounted on the rim mounting platethe encoder is mounted on the transmission shaft and the encoder is positioned between the rim mounting plate and the differential axle assembly According to the installation structure of the encoder the encoder is directly installed on the transmission shaft response is quicker the encoder is hidden on the inner side of the hub a vehicle body is sheltered the working performance of the encoder is guaranteed and the service life of the encoder is prolonged
