 CNU The thirdgeneration hub bearing comprises an outer ring an inner ring a rolling body and a sealing element a flange plate is arranged on the outer wall of the inner ring and the sealing element comprises a first sealing element body and a second sealing element body arranged on the side away from the flange plate of the first sealing element body the first sealing piece comprises a framework in interference fit with the outer ring and a first elastic piece wrapping the framework the second sealing piece comprises an outer framework in interference fit with the outer ring an inner framework in interference fit with the inner ring and a second elastic piece wrapping the outer framework and the outer ring extends towards the flange plate to form an extending part The gap between the opposite faces of the extending part and the flange plate is larger than  mm and smaller than or equal to  mm The gap between the outer ring and the flange plate is smaller than that between an existing thirdgeneration hub bearing but not in contact with the existing thirdgeneration hub bearing normal operation of the wheel is not affected and when the wheel is subjected to abnormal impact the flange plate can effectively support the outer ring to offset abnormal impact force And the early failure of the sealing element caused by local abrasion aggravation of the sealing elementis prevented
