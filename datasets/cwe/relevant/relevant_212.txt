 JPA To provide a bearing unit which maintains sealability by an O ring disposed in a butted area between an inner side end part of an outer ring and a cover member to effectively prevent entry of foreign objects such as water and slurry into a bearingSOLUTION A bearing unit for supporting a wheel includes an outer ring  connected to the vehicle body side a hub ring  which is disposed so as to rotate relatively to the outer ring  rolling elements  incorporated between the outer ring  and the hub ring  and a cover member  which is fitted in an inner side end part of the outer ring  to make a seal The bearing unit has a butted area  where the inner side end surface of the outer ring  and an outer side surface of the cover member  are butted in an axial direction A small diameter step part  of the inner side end part of the outer ring  and an eaves part  of the cover member  are located so as to overlap with each other in a radial direction at the outer diameter side of the butted area SELECTED DRAWING Figure
