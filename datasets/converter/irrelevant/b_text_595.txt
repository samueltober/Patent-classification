 WOA This power conversion system is provided with a fixed pulse pattern modulation unit  for generating a gate signal g on the basis of a command modulation rate d and a control phase  with reference to a table in which a pulse pattern the command voltage level of which is set for each modulation rate in accordance with phase information is stored and drives a power converter  on the basis of the gate signal g The fixed pulse pattern modulation unit  searches for during a pulse pattern transition an appropriate table reference position after the transition and causes the table reference position to follow the command voltage level L of the pulse pattern after the transition This makes it possible to perform pulse pattern transition without current impact and provides a power conversion system applicable also to a multilevel power converter having  levels or more
