 CNA     The invention discloses a converterbased power distribution system and a power distribution method The power distribution system includes a power supply device a first converter a power supply bus a second converter and a power supply load The power supply device and the first converter The first converter is connected to the power supply bus the power supply load is connected to the second converter and the second converter is connected to the power supply bus When the power supply system fails the converter on the fault side enters the reactive power operation mode and according to the amount of reactive power shortage the inductive or capacitive reactive power output of the converter is adjusted in real time to ensure the input side and output side of the power distribution system The voltage is stable When a serious AC fault occurs in the power supply system the converter on the fault side is cut off and the converter on the nonfault side enters the reactive power compensation operation mode or shuts down thus achieving fault isolation
