 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of automobiles and particularly relates to a method for improving automobile driving stability The method adopts a damper the damper comprises a workingcylinder barrel a piston shaft an upper lifting lug a lower lifting lug and a dustproof cover and further comprises a rotating device and a first rotating disc the outer wall of the working cylinder barrel is sleeved with the dustproof cover the piston shaft is arranged inside the working cylinder barrel hydraulic oil is contained at the bottom of the working cylinder barrel and the periphery of the piston shaft is sleeved with the rotating device Hydraulic oil is squeezed through the rotating device and flows in the working cylinder barrel one part of hydraulic oil acts to enable the rotating device to rotate the other part of hydraulic oil makes friction with a rotating plate to produce damping force and automobile vibration is buffered and in the flowing process of hydraulic oil the flowing speed of hydraulic oil is gradually reduced therefore the effects of rapid vibration and slow damping for automobiles are achieved self vibration of the damper is reduced and automobile driving stability is improved
