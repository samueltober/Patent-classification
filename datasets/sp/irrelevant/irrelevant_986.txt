 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of robots and particularly relates to a robot chassis A damping unit is arranged below a universal joint through mutual cooperation of a buffer mechanism a base a chassis steering seat and a rotating mechanism the stability in the vertical direction can be kept all the time movement of the universal joint in the vertical direction is limited andit is guaranteed that the chassis cannot be located on the ground due to the fact that the universal joint cannot be kept horizontal The shock absorption effect on the chassis is achieved deformation of the chassis is avoided driving safety of a robot is guaranteed practicability is high and reliability is high In addition four wheels are driven by double power sources and a steering mechanism is assisted so the chassis is flexible in steering and can achieve spot turn The steering mechanism provided by the invention can realize steering of a driving wheel under coupling drive thenumber of driving motors is reduced the cost of the chassis is reduced and meanwhile the chassis can perform translational motion and zeroradius steering
