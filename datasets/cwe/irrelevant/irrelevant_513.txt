 JPA To fulfill a required specification on a thermal shock resistance and a calcium chloride resistance while suppressing increase of a manufacturing cost in a protective cover having a sensor holder section provided with a partition wall between a magnetic encoder and a magnetic sensorSOLUTION A cup shaped protective cover is attached to an outer ring of a bearing so as to seal an inner right side end of the bearing The protective cover includes a synthetic resin disk part  and a synthetic resin sensor holder part  projecting from the disk part  inwardly A partition wall  separating the magnetic encoder and the magnetic sensor is formed to the disk part  A protective film layer  is provided to a surface A facing the magnetic sensor of the partition wall  The protective film layer  protects the partition wall  having a thin thickness being a weak point of the calcium chloride resistanceSELECTED DRAWING Figure A
