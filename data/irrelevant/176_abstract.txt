Apparatus features a matrix converter having a signal processor or processing module configured to receive signaling containing information about a motor winding temperature sensed inside a motor when the motor is not being required to produce torque and rotation and determine corresponding signaling containing information about a controlled direct current DC level for applying to at least one motor winding of the motor in order to provide a desired level of heating to the motor based upon the signaling received The signal processor or processing module provides the corresponding signaling so controlled DC signaling is sent to the at least one motor winding of the motor The signal processor or processing module also provides the corresponding signaling so alternating controlled DC signaling is sent to all three motor windings of the motor
