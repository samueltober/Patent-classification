 CNB The invention provides a control method of an energy storage modular multilevel converter in an offshore wind power system In a normal working mode by rationally controlling the energy storage modular multilevel converter virtual inertia compensation can be performed on wind farm virtual inertia having the same capacity as a synchronous generator is generated the wind power fluctuation is smoothened and the design of an offshore wind farm without a DC circuit breaker is achieved An AC winddriven generator side can still store the transmitted electric energy in an energy storage batterypack within certain time during a fault phase thereby reducing the configuration requirements of an unloading resistor in a winddriven generator set and reducing the cost and the volume weight ofthe winddriven generator set
