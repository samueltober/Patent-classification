 CNA The invention discloses a damping and automatic lifting device and an automated guided vehicle AGV provided with the device The damping and automatic lifting device comprises an upper top plate alower top plate at least three damping and automatic lifting mechanisms connected between the upper and lower top plates a center gear mechanism connected between the upper and lower top plates anda speed reducing motor arranged on a lower base plate each damping and automatic lifting mechanism is engaged with the center gear mechanism a small gear is arranged on a rotating shaft of the speed reducing motor and the small gear is engaged with the center gear mechanism Through arrangement of the lifting mechanisms the movement of the upper top plate and the lower base plate in the samedirection can be maintained without causing a twisting phenomenon between a steering wheel and a vehicle body and a damping spring in the center achieves support acting force on the upper top plate and the lower base plate so that the steering wheel AGV can be always effectively contacted with the ground no matter on which working pavements the vibration is reduced meanwhile the better groundgrabbing force is guaranteed and the operation stability of the steering wheel AGV is improved
