 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a technology for reducing an axial dimension from a brake disc to an inwheel motorSOLUTION An inwheel motor drive device  includes a wheel hub bearing part  having an outer ring  an inner ring  which is inserted through a center hole of the outer ring and protrudes from the outer ring to the one side in an axial O direction multiple rolling elements  arranged in multiple lines in an annular space between the outer ring and the inner ring and a fixing bolt  which fixes the outer ring to a nonrotation member  and a brake disc  having a connection portion  connected to one axial end part of the inner ring a cylindrical portion  extending from the connection portion to the other axial side and coaxially disposed with the inner ring and a friction circular disc portion  which expands from the other axial end part of the cylindrical portion to the outer diameter side and has a flangelike shape At least part of the fixing bolt is received by an inner space of the cylindrical portionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
