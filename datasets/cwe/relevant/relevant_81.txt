 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device for wheel that suppresses occurrence of hammering damage and even when hoop stress occurs at an inner ring in caulking suppress occurrence of delay fracture resulting from the hammering damage to improve durabilitySOLUTION A chamfer part  is formed at an inner diameter end part on a large end surface  of an inner ring  The chamber part  is composed of an arc surface  and an inclination surface  gradually inclined to an inner side from a tangent line of the arc surface  to radial outside An inclination angle  of the inclination surface  of the chamfer part  is set to  degrees or smaller An intersection part between the large end surface  of the inner ring  and the inclination surface  of the chamfer part  is made smoothly roundedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
