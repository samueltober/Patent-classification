 CNA     The invention relates to an electric vehicle structure and a kinetic energy recovery scheme The vehicle structure includes a power cabin a passenger cabin a horizontal damping structure between the power cabin and the passenger cabin a horizontal stable structure a supporting elastic structure and a balanced damping Mechanism battery suspension structure seat suspension structure The horizontal shockabsorbing structure and the horizontal stabilizing structure can bear the force in the horizontal direction of the vehicle the supporting elastic structure can bear the load of the passenger cabin and the force in the height direction of the vehicle and the balance damping mechanism can bear the force of the vehicle in the horizontal direction Use the cabin to make active lifting or lowering actions which can balance the changes in the external force received or about to be received by the passenger cabin with active antiroll active elimination or weakening of pitch caused by starting and braking or climbing and downhill Effect the ability to maintain the smooth operation of the passenger cabin The battery suspension structure and the seat suspension structure can delay the recovery of part of the kinetic energy improve the efficiency of the vehicle kinetic energy recovery and improve the ride comfort
