 CNU The utility model relates to an electric wheel The electric wheel comprises a builtin suspension guide mechanism and a motor Wherein the builtin suspension guide mechanism is connected with the frame the builtin suspension guide mechanism is connected with the hub through a bearing and the hub drives the frame to move through the builtin suspension guide mechanism The motor is connected with the builtin suspension guide mechanism the motor is connected with the frame through the builtin suspension guide mechanism and the unsprung mass of the vehicle is reduced When the electric wheel encounters a bumpy road condition the builtin suspension guide mechanism absorbs vibration energy The vibration of the motor and the frame is reduced and the running smoothness of the vehicleis improved
