 CNU     The utility model belongs to the technical field of robotic equipment and in particular relates to an omnidirectional motion robot which includes a chassis frame and an even number of suspension drive systems wherein each suspension drive system includes a fixed seat a power output assembly a steering bracket assembly and a vibration reduction The device drives the entire robot to move and walk through the suspension drive system The vibration damping device of the suspension drive system realizes the damping effect in the longitudinal and transverse directions during the movement and walking The power output assembly outputs power to the steering bracket assembly In the process of moving and walking the omnidirectional moving robot rotates at any angle to realize the moving walking steering function Each suspension driving system independently realizes the driving walking function and the vibration damping function so that the omnidirectional moving robot has better obstacle surmounting ability In summary the application of the technical solution of the utility model solves the problems of poor vibration damping ability and poor obstacle surpassing ability of the existing robot chassis system
