 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of automobile suspension frame systems and particularly relates to a composite dampingadjustable feed energy type active suspension frame actuator and a control method thereof Through the organic combination of an actuator control system and an actuator body composed of an oil storage cylinder a work cylinder a proportional solenoid valve and a power transmission mechanism the defect of large energy consumption of traditional active suspension frames is overcome through simple control not only is the damping effect of a suspension frame improved but also the vibration energy can be recycled The actuator can be switched between an active control mode and a feed energy mode when used and a realtime variable damping effect is achieved The control operation stability and the reliability are high faults are unlikely to occur and frequent maintenance and repair are not needed the actuator is high in integration degree and practicability great in use effect and convenient to popularize on the market
