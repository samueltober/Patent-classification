 CNA The invention provides a steering mechanism a steering system and a vehicle Due to the fact that each steering mechanism in a steering system corresponds to one single wheel each wheel is providedwith an independent steering mechanism and each wheel can achieve very flexible and largeramplitude steering In this way the steering system of the present invention can achieve more steering modes and improve steering capability compared with a steering system of the prior art Furthermore a vehicle including the steering system of the present invention can also achieve more steering modes and improve steering capability In addition the steering mechanism is further provided with an angle sensor capable of measuring the actual steering angles of the wheels so that the steering systemcan conduct closedloop control over the steering of the wheels on the basis of actual steering angles and therefore more accurate steering control over the vehicle can be conducted
