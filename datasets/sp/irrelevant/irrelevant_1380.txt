 CNA The invention discloses an automobile hydraulic buffer The automobile hydraulic buffer comprises a pipe body a piston a piston rod a spring a bearing an oil inlet cavity and a return oil cavityA damping unit is arranged in the pipe body The damping unit comprises a base fixed to the interior of the pipe body A sleeve body is fixed to the base An extension sleeve is fixed to the sleeve body The extension sleeve and the piston form motive seal A core body is embedded in the sleeve body The core body has the degree of freedom to rotating along the periphery of the axis of the pipe body relative to the pipe body The damping effect of the buffer is improved Impact force generated by the spring during extension and contraction is reduced The comfort ability is improved Meanwhile through the structure design of the damping unit the automobile hydraulic buffer buffers flowing oil so that the oil flows more stably the damping stability is improved and vibration caused byunstable flowing of the oil is reduced
