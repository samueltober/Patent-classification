 CNA     The invention discloses an ACDC power conversion circuit and a conversion method thereof The DC bus voltage is maintained above the input voltage requirement of the subsequent DC converter through a bidirectional DC converter connected to the rectifier circuit thereby prolonging the AC The length of the time interval for the input power supply to provide energy to the downstream DC converter and reduces the capacity and volume requirements of the first capacitor in the rectifier circuit and the second capacitor at the second end of the DC converter which can greatly reduce the rectifier bridge The total volume of the capacitor is used to reduce the volume of the power converter thereby increasing the power density of the power converter
