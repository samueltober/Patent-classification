 CNA The invention relates to a transverse stabilizer bar pull rod assembly with adjustable roll stiffness which comprises an upper rod and a lower rod wherein the upper end and the lower end of the upper rod are connected with a suspension and two buffer material installation sleeves respectively polyurethane materials are fixed to the two buffer material installation sleeves the upper end and thelower end of the lower rod are connected with a transverse stabilizer bar and a sleeve respectively an end cover is installed on the sleeve structure a selflubricating bearing is installed in an inner hole the upper rod the two buffer material installation sleeves and two polyurethane materials are inserted into a cavity of the sleeve structure through the selflubricating bearing Startingfrom the angle of force transmission control of the transverse stabilizer bar and the suspension system the split design is adopted the structure is simple implementation is easy the effect of supporting and connecting the transverse stabilizer bar can be achieved and when the roll angle of a vehicle body is small or wheels on the left side and the right side generate smallamplitude and frequent vertical relative displacement the force transmission path of the transverse stabilizer bar is closed and when the roll angle of the vehicle body is large the force transmission path of the transverse stabilizer bar is opened and the chassis stability and comfort are both considered
