 JPA To inexpensively and efficiently manufacture a slinger for a rotation seal which can suppress the wear of a seal lip part while securing an oil film holding property between a slide contact face of the slinger and the seal lip partSOLUTION A manufacturing method of a slinger for use in a rotation seal includes a process for forming an annular blank material from a dullfinished material of a steel plate by sheetmetal press processing or the like and a process for forming the slinger  by applying burring processing to the blank material In a burring processing metal mold C the arithmetic average roughness Ra of faces A B abutting on a first slidecontact face and a second slidecontact face of the slinger  is set as  mRa m A pressurization force for gripping the blank material is set at  or larger and  or smaller at a strength ratio of the dullfinished material A clearance of the burring processing metal mold C is set as T to  with a plate thickness of the blank material as T By this constitution the arithmetic average roughness Ra of the first slidecontact face and the second slidecontact face of the slinger  is set as  mRa mSELECTED DRAWING Figure B
