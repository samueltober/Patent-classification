 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of hub forging and particularly relates to a new energy automobile hub forging process A hole cutting device used in the process comprises a cylindricalworkbench a bracket is arranged at the top end of the workbench the bracket is of a cylindrical structure two or more leaking grooves are formed in the top end of the bracket at equal intervals inthe circumferential direction of the bracket a takingout hole is formed in the side wall of the bracket a circular ring is rotationally mounted on the outer side wall of the workbench a gear ringis fixed to the outer side wall of the circular ring a drive motor is fixed to the side wall of the workbench a gear disc is fixed to the output shaft end of the drive motor and the gear disc is engaged with the gear ring and holes are cut in a hub prototype so that the redundant portion of the hub prototype is cut off on one hand materials needed for manufacturing a hub are saved the production cost is reduced and on the other hand the holes are cut in the hub so that the working task amount of a subsequent lathe is reduced the forging efficiency of the hub is improved and the production efficiency of the hub is further improved
