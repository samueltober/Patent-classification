 WOA A retainer of an angular contact ball bearing has an annular portion positioned on one axialdirection side of the angular contact ball bearing a plurality of columnar portions extending from the annular portion toward the other side in the axial direction and pockets configured so as to accommodate the balls The pockets each have at a point on a rotation center line of the respective ball which line is orthogonal to an imaginary straight light when the retainer shifts toward the other side in the axial direction a contact surface portion configured so as to be in point contact with the ball and a noncontact surface portion provided adjacent to the contact surface portion The noncontact surface does not come into contact with the ball even when the retainer shifts toward the other side in the axial direction
