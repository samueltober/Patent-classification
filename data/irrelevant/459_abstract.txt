The invention discloses a control device which comprises a locking mechanism control circuit a locking sensor and an unlocking sensor The locking mechanism control circuit comprises a locking switch an unlocking switch a first relay a first contactor a second relay and a second contactor a normallyclosed contact of the first relay is connected with a solenoid of the first contactor a normallyclosed contact of the second relay is connected with a solenoid of the second contactor a solenoid of the first contactor controls a first switch with a common end connected with power supply voltage and a second switch with a common end grounded a solenoid control common end of the second contactor is connected with a third switch and a fourth switch at positive and negative ends of a motor the first switch the third switch the second switch and the fourth switch are sequentially connected in series to form an annular circuit and a normallyclosed contact of any switch is connectedwith normallyopen contacts of adjacent switches in sequence The switching output of forward rotation reverse rotation and rotation stop signals of the motor can be realized by adopting the combination of the relays and the contactors The control device is simple in circuit structure and time delay can be effectively shortened by the pure hardware circuits
