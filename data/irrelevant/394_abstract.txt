The invention discloses an adjacent channel interference suppression method and device based on inverse filtering The method comprises the following steps S filtering outofband nonlinear components of an interference signal by using a bandlimiting filter S carrying out downconversion on the obtained bandlimited signal and sending the obtained bandlimited signal to a narrowband ADC for sampling to obtain a baseband signal S performing inverse filtering on the bandlimited baseband signal to recover an interference signal with a complete bandwidth and S reconstructing and counteracting the adjacent channel interference by using the recovery signal According to the adjacent channel interference suppression method and device structure the auxiliary branch is constructed on the receiver the interference signal is reconstructed through the time domain inverse filtering technology and finally the reconstructed signal is subtracted from the received signal so that thebandwidth requirement of the receiver for a sampling ADC is remarkably reduced and engineering application of the adjacent channel interference suppression method is facilitated
