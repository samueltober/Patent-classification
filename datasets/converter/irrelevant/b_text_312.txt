 USA A power conversion device includes three inverters configured to convert DC power of DC buses into singlephase AC power and a controller configured to control the three inverters so as to generate threephase AC power The controller is configured to generate a fundamental wave command for generating onephase AC power constituting the threephase AC power and to generate an adjustment wave command having triple the frequency of the fundamental wave command Additionally the controller is configured to output a phase voltage command in which the adjustment wave command is superimposed on the fundamental wave command and to determine an initial phase of the adjustment wave command to be offset from an initial phase of the fundamental wave command so as to reduce a voltage ripple occurring in the DC buses at double the frequency of the fundamental wave command
