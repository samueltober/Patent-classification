 CNA The invention discloses a vehicle tire pressure quickdrop emergency protection control system and a control method thereof An input interface of a central processing module is connected with a tirepressure and vehicle state monitoring module and an output interface of the central processing module is connected with a control module and an alarm A core execution mechanism of an execution module is a tire pressure quickdrop emergency protection device which comprises a parallelogram mechanism an air bag assembly and an anticollision block and the air bag assembly comprises a gas generator and a protection air bag When abnormities such as tire pressure quick drop happen to a vehicle an alarm can be given or emergency protection operation can be executed at the same time according to the information such as the tire pressure drop rate the vehicle speed and the road condition protective air bags at all suspensions are detonated in a proper mode and are vertically embedded and fixed into anticollision block pits in the vehicle body parts at the tops of all wheels under the action of parallelogram mechanism so that the functions of adjusting vehicle body posture and wheel positioning parameters similar to an active suspension are achieved the vertical load acting on each wheel is redistributed so that the stress of each wheel is adjusted and the vehicle quickly tendsto an ideal motion state
