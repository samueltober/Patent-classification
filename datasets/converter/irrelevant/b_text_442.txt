 USB The present invention provides a protection circuit and related operation control method to enable the PFM circuit when the operating duration of the PFM circuit is not greater than a first threshold and disables the PFM circuit when a rest duration of the PFM circuit is not greater than a second threshold The present invention further provides a protection circuit and related operation control method to avoid starting excessive vertical scanning operations within one frame scanning period by masking one of the gate scanning start signal STV the gate clock signal CKV and the gate discharge signal OEV The present invention further provides a protection circuit and related operation control method to disable the gate scanning start signal STV when the number of clock cycles is not equal to a target number of clock cycles which protects the gate driver from overload
