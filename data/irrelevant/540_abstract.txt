A converter circuitry between a first network which may be either a polyphase mediumvoltage alternating current AC network at least one polyphase lowvoltage AC network or at least one directcurrent DC network and a second network which may be either a polyphase mediumvoltage AC network or a mediumvoltage DC network wherein the converter circuitry comprises at least one power bus and lowvoltage power cells both at the first and at the second network side such that each power cell is connected to a power bus via a transformer Each power bus is connected to a lowvoltage power unit which is able to supply precharging power via the power bus to all power cell intermediate DClink filtering capacitors before the converter is started The lowvoltage power unit is also able to take care of a resistor braking in case the first network cannot take the power supplied by the load connected to the second network
