 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle suspension vibration control and particularly relates to a semiactive suspension ceiling damping control method based on damping force closedloop control According to the method a state of a damping force of a semiactive actuator is monitored in real time through a damping force monitoring system a vertical acceleration of the vehiclebody is measured through a sprung mass acceleration sensor and a vibration speed of the vehicle body is reconstructed through an integral or state observerfilter an expected damping force is obtained through an improved ceiling damping controller according to the vehicle body vibration speed and a smooth control currentvoltage is obtained through a semiactive actuator force closedloop controller according to an error and a mapping relation between the expected damping force and the actual damping force Compared with a traditional ceiling damping control method the method has the advantages that unsprung mass acceleration does not need to be installed or the unsprung mass vibration speed and a relative speed between the sprung mass and the unsprung mass do not need to be indirectlyobtained through the state observerfilter and the output of the ceiling damping controller can be obtained only through one piece of information of the vehicle body vibration speed
