 CNU An independent steering suspension device comprises a supporting plate and a connecting frame a suspension frame is installed above the supporting plate a guide supporting column is installed in themiddle of the suspension frame a sliding block is movably connected to the outer surface of the guide supporting column and springs are arranged on the upper surface and the lower surface of the sliding block A steering motor is fixedly installed below the supporting plate a driving shaft of the steering motor is in transmission connection with the driven wheel through a synchronous belt thelower surface of the driving shaft driven wheel is fixedly connected with one end of a steering main pin and the other end of the steering main pin is movably connected with the axle surface of a tire The steering device overcomes the defects in the prior art is reasonable in design simple and convenient and can achieve largeangle steering of about  degrees The steering kingpin is kept perpendicular to the ground constantly uneven friction of inner and outer rings of the tire is avoided overall transverse rigidity is improved and side tilting of a turning vehicle body is reduced
