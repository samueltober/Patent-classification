 CNU A connecting shaft is arranged on one side of an inner flange a thread is fixedly arranged at one end of the connecting shaft the surface of the connecting shaft and one side of the inner flange arefixedly connected with a sleeve cover in a sleeved mode and the surface of the connecting shaft is fixedly connected with a clamping ring in a sleeved mode The surface of the connecting shaft is fixedly connected with a first tapered roller and a second tapered roller in a sleeved mode the surface of the thread is rotatably connected with a nut and the surface of one side of the outer flangeis fixedly connected with heat dissipation holes Friction force brought by the connecting shaft during rotation is reduced through the first tapered roller and the second tapered roller the rotationspeed is increased speedup rotation can be better carried out oil consumption is reduced the first tapered roller and the second tapered roller are clamped through the clamping ring the first tapered roller and the second tapered roller cannot shake or fall off and the service life of the connecting shaft is prolonged And when the heat dissipation holes are shortened and the heat energy isrotated for a long time components in the inner flange can cause short service life
