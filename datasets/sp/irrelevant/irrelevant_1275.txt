 KRA The present invention relates to a strut bearing mounted on a suspension device The strut bearing mounted on a suspension device includes an upper body and a lower body in which a central shaft in a height direction is assembled to the suspension to be inclined with respect to a longitudinal central shaft of a rod reciprocating in a damper cylinder wherein a guide pipe through which the rod passes is provided in the lower body toward the damper cylinder the longitudinal central shaft of the guide pipe is horizontal with the longitudinal central shaft of the rod and an end of a dust cover is only rotated in the guide pipe when the dust cover is rotated due to a lateral load while driving thereby preventing the dust cover from being separated from the guide pipe
