A method for controlling a voltage source power converter of a renewable energy power conversion system includes providing a voltage source power converter the voltage source power converter having at least a rotorside converter and a lineside converter The method also includes generating via the converter controller a first set of switching pulses based on a thirdharmonic inverted carrierbased pulse width modulation POCBPWM scheme Furthermore the method includes generating a second set of switching pulses based on a third harmonic inphase carrierbased pulse width modulation IPCBPWM scheme via the converter controller Therefore the method includes using the first set and the second set of switching pulses via the converter controller to implement the pulse width modulation schemes for the rotorside converter and the lineside converter respectively to obtain information about the expected amplitude from the voltage source converter Value shape andor frequency of the output voltage
