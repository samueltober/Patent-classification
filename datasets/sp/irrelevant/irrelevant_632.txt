 FRA         Hydraulic motor vehicle suspension end stop braking an axial movement directed towards a forward direction AV comprising a rear compression chamber  which during braking transmits its fluid through a column of fluid inertia  to a reservoir  maintaining a pressure in the fluid the compression chamber  being linked to an axially sliding piston  which undergoes a forward force coming from a feed spring  connected to a suspension element  during compression of this suspension and a rearward force coming from a height compensation chamber  bearing on a stop body  supplied with pressurized fluid by the reservoir  through a fluid passage restriction     Figure for the abstract Fig
