 CNU The spherical hinge for the commercial vehicle chassis rubber suspension comprises a metal outer sleeve polyurethane rubber a mandrel a selflubricating bearing and a pin shaft the polyurethane rubber is adhered to the inner wall of the metal outer sleeve through an adhesive the mandrel is installed in the polyurethane rubber in an embedded mode the selflubricating bearing is installed on the inner wall of the mandrel and the selflubricating bearing is installed on the inner wall of the mandrel A pin shaft is installed in the selflubricating bearing a set of assembling holes are formed in the inner sides of the two ends of the pin shaft respectively and two sets of antidisengaging groove structures connected with the metal outer sleeve are arranged on the outer contour of the mandrel Through structural optimization the requirement for vertical jumping of the axle is met through the characteristic that the polyurethane rubber and the core shaft freely rotate meanwhile the core shaft deflects to compress the polyurethane rubber to generate certain deflection rigidity and the problem of deflection of a beam body is solved By additionally arranging the antifalling groove structure the polyurethane rubber can be effectively prevented from axially falling off from the outer wall of the mandrel
