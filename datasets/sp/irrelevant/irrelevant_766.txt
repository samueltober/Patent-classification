 CNA The invention discloses a lower cross arm connecting structure used on a wire control steering vehicle The lower cross arm connecting structure comprises a steering knuckle a steering motor seat fixedly arranged on one side of the steering knuckle a lower cross arm a pin shaft two shaft sleeves two first bearings two glands and two compression bolts A first shaft hole is formed in one sideof the steering motor seat Two supporting lugs are arranged on one side of the lower cross beam and second shaft holes are formed in the supporting lugs The pin shaft penetrates the second shaft holes and the first shaft hole at the same time so that the lower cross arm can be rotationally connected with the steering motor seat The two shaft sleeves are arranged at the two ends of the pin shaft in a sleeving manner correspondingly The inner rings of the two first bearings are correspondingly arranged at the other ends of the shaft sleeves in a sleeving manner The two glands correspondingly abut against the outer rings of the first bearings and are fixedly connected with the second shaft holes and inner threaded holes are formed in the glands in the axial direction By means of thestructure when wheels jump a clearance can be prevented from being generated between the motor seat and the lower cross arm during vehicle motion
