A converter arrangement   is disclosed which is configured to couple an AC power system   with a DC power system  The converter arrangement   comprises a plurality ofconverter modules  electrically connected in series at a DC pole Tl T T T for example between a first DC pole Tl T and a second DC pole T T or between a DC pole and ground Atleast one converter module  is configured such that the at least one converter valve   N  N  N  N  N  N thereof is controllably switchable between conducting states with a selected current conduction direction and a nonconducting state so as to selectively control polarity of any voltage contribution provided by the at least one multilevel converter cell  N  N  N  N  N  N of the converter module
