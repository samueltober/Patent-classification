 WOA Hydraulic systems and methods for reducing the propagation of flow andor pressure pulsations within a hydraulic system are described In one embodiment a hydraulic system may include a hydraulic device and a differential buffer fluidly connected to the hydraulic device The differential buffer may include a piston that is exposed to pressure pulsations that propagate along separate flow paths and that are at least partially out of phase with one another Corresponding displacement of the piston due to the out of phase pulsations may at least partially mitigate propagation of the pulsations within the hydraulic system downstream from the differential buffer
