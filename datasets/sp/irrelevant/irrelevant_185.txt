 USA A swing arm type suspension for a rear wheel of an off road vehicle can use two or three tie rods to control toein of the knuckle The rear end of the swing arm is split between an upper clamping arm and a lower clamping arm defining an eye with the knuckle connected to the upper and lower clamping arms by joint bearings and with either the transmission shaft or one of the tie rods extending through the eye of the swing arm to the knuckle The front of the swing arm can be connected to the vehicle frame using a crossshaft joint Camber toein and halftrack width are controlled to result in a smaller turning radius with better ride characteristics
