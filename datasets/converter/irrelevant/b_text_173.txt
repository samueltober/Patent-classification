 CNA The present disclosure relates to a method performed by a control system of a power electronics converter The method comprises providing a gridside current controller for controlling power output from the converter to a power grid A first part A of the controller runs a first feedback control algorithm having a first control cycle time and includes at least proportional control using a proportional gain Kp A third part C of the controller runs a third feedback control algorithm having the first control cycle time and acting on an output Yctriout from the first control algorithm after SOA limits  have been applied and includes counteracting the proportional control of the first feedback control algorithm A second part B of the controller runs a second feedback control algorithm having a second control cycle time less than the first control cycle time and acting on an output UCOnvref from the third control algorithm with the same polarity as the first control algorithm and includes proportional control using the proportional gain Kp
