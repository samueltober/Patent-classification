 CNA The invention provides a fault processing method a fault processing device and a directcurrent power transmission system The method comprises the following steps in response to a fault signal of adirectcurrent power transmission system switching off a directcurrent circuit breaker turning on the solidstate switch branch after the deionization time length acquiring voltage and current ofa power transmission line of the directcurrent power transmission system determining the ratio of voltage to current determining a fault state of the DC power transmission system according to theratio and controlling the DC circuit breaker according to the fault state Therefore the fault state is identified after the deionization is finished reclosing is carried out only after the instantaneous fault is judged after the permanent fault is judged reclosing is not carried out any more the fault pole current converter is directly locked selfadaptive reclosing of the directcurrent circuit breaker is achieved only through electrical quantity under the condition that extra voltage and current impact is not generated secondary impact on a power transmission system due to the factthat reclosing is carried out on the permanent fault is effectively avoided and the safety of the directcurrent power transmission system is improved
