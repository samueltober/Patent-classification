The invention discloses a seriesparallel hybrid multilevel converter with energy storage and a dual phaseshifting PWM control method The multilevel converter is composed of modular power units that are connected in parallel and then connected in series Multiple power units are connected in parallel to form a parallel group and multiple parallel groups are sequentially connected in series to form a singlephase electrical circuit one end of which is connected to the corresponding phase of the power grid and the other end is connected as a common end to the common ends of the other two phases The invention adopts the hybrid connection mode of modular power unit parallel  series connection to realize the multiplication of the converter capacity but the converter is externally embodied as a single voltage source converter which avoids dynamic balance when multiple voltage source converters are connected in parallel Control difficult problems
