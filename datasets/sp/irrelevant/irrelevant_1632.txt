 CNU The utility model discloses a cantilever beam assembly with a conical buffer structure The cantilever beam assembly comprises a damping rod a spring limiting seat a conical buffer block and a connecting block the damping rod is assembled in the damping cylinder through the piston to form the piston type damper the mounting disc assembly is fixed to the top end of the damping rod through the large nut the middle section of the bottom of the damping cylinder is sleeved with the spring limiting seat and the mounting seat is welded to the bottommost section of the damping cylinder A gear is installed on the bottom section of the vibration reduction cylinder in the mode that a rotating shaft is assembled on the bottom section of the vibration reduction cylinder through a bearing a handle is welded to the front end face of the gear a big spring originally directly arranged on the outer side of the vibration reduction cylinder in a sleeving mode is changed into a left spring and a right spring and due to the fact that a guide rod can be rotationally dismantled the spring sleeved outside the guide rod can be dismantled Therefore the problem that the spring in the damping mechanism in the existing cantilever beam assembly is not easy to detach and replace during plastic deformation is solved
