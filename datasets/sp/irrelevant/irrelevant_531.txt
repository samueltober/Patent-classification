 WOA An activepassive dual mode switchable vehicle suspension system The system comprises a filter  a hydraulic pump  a check valve  a power takeoff  a servo valve  a suspension cylinder  a overflow valve  an energy accumulator  a reversing valve  a first pressure sensor  a second pressure sensor  a controller  a fuel tank  and a displacement sensor  Further related is a switching method for the activepassive dual mode switchable vehicle suspension system When switching the mode the fuel hydraulic pressure in the rodless cavity of the suspension cylinder is adjusted in advance to be equal to the fuel hydraulic pressure in the energy accumulator a stable switching between active and passive suspension modes is thus achieved so as to eliminate oscillation of the vehicle body during the existing switching between active and passive suspension systems Moreover the energy accumulator and the overflow valve can be shared in active and passive suspension modes thereby effectively decreasing the usage amount of energy accumulators and overflow valves greatly saving the space of the vehicle body effectively reducing the gross mass of the vehicle body and facilitating the light weight of the vehicle chassis
