The invention discloses a secondary side PWM rectification multipath output circuit which comprises an inversion control circuit an isolation conversion circuit a demagnetization circuit and a secondary side PWM modulation circuit The output voltage is synchronously modulated on a secondary side of a forward transformer the stability of multiple paths of output voltage can be met and the cross regulation rate of the output voltage under the condition that each path outputs different load power is met The primary side input voltage of the transformer is a signal with fixed frequency andduty ratio PWM chopping modulation is carried out on the signal according to coupling characteristics of the transformer and signals with fixed frequency and duty ratio of output of each path of thesecondary side control of output voltage can be realized by matching with output inductance and capacitance of each path modulation of each path of voltage is mutually independent thereby avoidingmutual influence
