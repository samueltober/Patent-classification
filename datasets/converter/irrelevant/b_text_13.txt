 USB A collection charging and distribution machine collects charges and distributes portable electrical energy storage devices eg batteries super or ultracapacitors To charge the machine employs electrical current from an external source such as the electrical grid or an electrical service of an installation location The machine determines a first number of devices to be rapidly charged employing charge from a second number of devices identified to sacrifice charge Thus some devices may be concurrently charged via current from the electrical service and current from other devices to achieve rapid charging of some subset of devices The devices that sacrifice charge may later be charged Such may ensure availability of devices for end users Collection charging and distribution machines may be deployed individually or as networked collection charging and distribution modules with one collection charging and distribution module controlling at least one other collection charging and distribution module
