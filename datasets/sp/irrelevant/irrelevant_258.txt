 CNB The invention discloses an active suspension using a rubber spring concentric with an active force actuator A first rubber spring consisting of a rigid outer ring a rubber main spring a rigid guiderail and a rigid inner tube is concentrically and fixedly connected to the lower end of an inner cylinder of the active force actuator the upper end of the rigid outer ring is fixedly connected withthe lower end of the inner cylinder the rubber main spring is accommodated in the right middle of the interior of the rigid outer ring the rigid inner tube which is placed in the frontandback direction penetrates through the rubber main spring the central axis of the rigid inner tube is perpendicularly intersected with that of the active force actuator the front and back ends of the rigid inner tube are each rigidly connected with the upper end of an inner tube mounting seat the upper end of the outer cylinder of the active force actuator is concentrically and rigidly connected with the lower end of a rigid outer ring of a second rubber spring whose structure is as same as the structure of the first rubber spring and a spiral spring coaxially sleeves the exterior of the outer cylinder Except for a primary vibration absorbing function formed by the active force actuator and the spiral spring the active suspension using the rubber spring concentric with the active force actuator also has a secondary vibration absorbing function formed by the first rubber spring and a threestage vibration absorbing function formed by the second rubber spring
