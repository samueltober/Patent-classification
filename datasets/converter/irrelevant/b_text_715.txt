 USA Techniques and apparatus for supplying power to gate drivers of a switchedmode power supply SMPS circuit One example power supply circuit generally includes a SMPS circuit having a first input voltage node and a second input voltage node and a charge pump The charge pump generally includes a first capacitive element having a first terminal and a second terminal a first switch coupled between a first input node of the charge pump and the first terminal of the first capacitive element a second switch coupled between the second terminal of the first capacitive element and a second input node of the charge pump a third switch coupled between the first terminal of the first capacitive element and the first input voltage node of the SMPS circuit and a fourth switch coupled between the second terminal of the first capacitive element and the second input voltage node of the SMPS circuit
