 USA A multilevel power converter or inverter for converting a direct current electrical power to an alternating current electrical power includes one or more level converters each including gallium nitride GaN transistors configured to switch two input lines to a threephase output line The multilevel power converter may be used in a motor drive circuit which may provide a phase AC supply Two power converters which may be level or level power converters may be alternately switched to provide the AC power to an AC motor by an output stage including bidirectional switching transistors configured to switch a corresponding threephase output lines from the multilevel power converters The multilevel power converters switch input lines from a neutralpoint clamped input stage including capacitors connected in series across input terminals having a DC voltage therebetween to energize a midpoint terminal with an intermediate voltage half of the voltage between the input terminals
