The invention discloses a current source type high frequency isolation matrix type cascade converter and a control method including a threephase AC power grid is connected to two current source type matrix converters to transmit electric energy after LC filtering high frequency isolation The input of the primary side of the transformer is connected in series with the matrix converter and the output of the secondary side is connected to an uncontrolled rectifier bridge Two sets of current source highfrequency isolation matrix cascaded converters are connected in parallel on the AC side with a common LC filter and the DC output side is connected in series Inductive load In this system the power frequency AC is converted to the high frequency AC form by the threephasesinglephase direct matrix converter the DC bus capacitance is removed the system failure rate is reduced the number of power conversion stages is reduced and the system volume is greatly reduced The control technical scheme of the present invention makes the switch of the matrix converter device flexible suppresses the electromagnetic interference problem caused by the highfrequency operation of the switch device and meets the industrial needs of offshore wind power generation electric vehicle charging etc and has broad application prospects
