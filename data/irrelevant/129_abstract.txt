A first converter station is part of a high voltage direct current transmission system that includes a DC transmission link connected to the first converter station a second converter station A DC current and a DC voltage of the DC transmission link are sensed by the first converter station It is determined that the sensed DC current is equal to or larger than a threshold current value that the sensed DC current is equal to or larger than the threshold current value and that at least a partial recovery of the sensed DC voltage has occurred On the basis that it is determined that the at least a partial recovery of the sensed DC voltage has occurred it is determined that a phasetoground fault has occurred In response to determining that a phasetoground fault has occurred a power delivered by the first converter station can be reduced
