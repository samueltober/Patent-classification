A reverse current comparator suitable for a Boost converter comprises a reverse current signal generation module and a reverse current signal latch module wherein the reverse current signal generation module is used for comparing a common drain end voltage of a switch power tube and a synchronous rectifier tube with an output voltage of the Boost converter and generating a reverse current signal when the synchronous rectifier tube is started in a reverse current signal latch module a clock signal of the Boost converter is connected with a first input end of a second AND gate after passing through a time delay unit and is also connected with a second input end of the second AND gate the gate electrode of the first NMOS tube is connected with the output end of the second AND gate the drain electrode of a first NMOS tube is connected with the drain electrode of a first PMOS tube and the gate electrode of a second PMOS tube and the source electrode of the first NMOS tube is connected with the source electrode of a second NMOS tube and grounded the gate electrode of the second NMOS tube is connected with a reverse current signal and the drain electrode of the second NMOS tube is connected with the gate electrode of the first PMOS tube and the drain electrode of a second PMOS tube passes through a second inverter and then is connected with the output end of the reverse current comparator and the source electrodes of the first PMOS tube and the second PMOS tube are connected with a power supply voltage The reverse current comparator has the advantages of high efficiency stability low cost and low power consumption
