 CNA The invention which belongs to the DCDC converter field discloses a power transmission method and device of a bidirectional wireless electric energy transmission system The method comprises stepsof maintaining a switching frequency of a first fullbridge converter unchanged and reducing a switching frequency of a second fullbridge converter under a light load condition collecting a currentoutput signal of the first fullbridge converter subtracting the current output signal from a set value performing PI control and normalizing the current output signal into an internal phase shiftangle beta of the first fullbridge converter calculating a fundamental wave phase shift phase angle delta of the first fullbridge converter and an internal phase shift angle beta of the second fullbridge converter through a ZVS soft switching condition function and an efficiency optimization function based on beta updating parameters in the digital processor of the first fullbridge converter according to beta and delta and updating parameters in the digital processor of the second fullbridge converter according to beta so that the first fullbridge converter and the second fullbridge converter respectively output symmetrical square waves with the pulse widths of beta and beta and the component phase difference of the corresponding frequencies of the two symmetrical squarewaves is delta ZVS soft switching is easier to realize and the system transmission efficiency is improved
