 JPA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a structure of a rolling bearing unit for supporting a wheel capable of securing electric power necessary for operating a sensor reducing costs of a device as a whole and reducing a throwaway part in changing a tireSOLUTION A connector  to be connected with a noncontact power supply coil and a sensor disposed on the outside of the rolling bearing unit  for supporting a wheel a power controller  performing stabilization processing of the power and a wireless communication unit  for wirelessly communicating with a computing unit at a vehicle body side are arranged in the inside of a rolling bearing unit  for supporting the wheel Thus the power is taken in from the noncontact power supply coil through a power input terminal  of the connector  is subjected to stabilization processing by the power controller  and then supplied to the sensor through a power output terminal  An output signal of the sensor is taken in through a signal input terminal  and is transmitted to the computing unit at the vehicle body side by the wireless communication unit SELECTED DRAWING Figure
