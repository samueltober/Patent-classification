 CNB The invention discloses a multimode switching control method of a hydraulic hub hybrid vehicle and belongs to the field of hybrid vehicle control The multimode switching control method includes the steps that working modes are divided travelling working condition characteristics are abstracted a preliminary mapping relationship between the working condition characteristics and working condition modes is established and the optimal control mode is refined As for the multimode switching control method based on vehicle travelling working condition identification and critical state estimation by combining with a system global optimal algorithm and through optimal rule extraction and an energy accumulator SOC optimal using path planning algorithm the optimal control rule is obtained According to the multimode switching control method of the hydraulic hub hybrid vehicle the comprehensive influence of the vehicle state and the hydraulic system state is considered a whole vehicle controller arbitrates independently and thus the optimum working mode under the current working condition is determined the multimode switching control method aims to plan a using path of an energy accumulator SOC in the full working condition range thus a system achieves the high average comprehensive transmission efficiency and thus the adaptability of the hub hydraulic hybrid vehicle to different road surface working conditions and the economical efficiency of the whole vehicle are improved
