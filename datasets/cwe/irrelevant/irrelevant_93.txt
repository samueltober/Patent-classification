 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device with a generator which is raised in a design freedom secures an installation space of a generator and is increased in a power generation capacity by the upsize of a field componentSOLUTION An annular salient part  extending to an axial direction is formed at a side face c of a vehicle body attachment flange b of an outer member  at an inner side a stator  which constitutes a generator  is attached into an annular space  which is formed between the salient part  and an external peripheral face d of the outer member  and a permanent magnetic  is attached to a flangeshaped rotor case  which extends to the outside of a radial direction from a shoulder part  of an outside joint member  and is integrally formed The permanent magnetic is oppositely arranged at the stator  via an air gap in the axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
