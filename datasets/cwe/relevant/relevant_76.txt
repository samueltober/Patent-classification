 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing for a vehicle capable of reducing a weight by a lightalloy portion and effectively suppressing relative movement of the lightalloy portion and a raceway memberSOLUTION A baring  for a vehicle includes a bearing ring  The bearing ring  includes a raceway member  a lightalloy portion  and a columnar member  The raceway member  has annular raceway surfaces a b and a groove c and composed of a material including steel The raceway surfaces a b are formed on an inner peripheral surface of the raceway member  The groove c is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the raceway member  and axially extended The lightalloy portion  is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the raceway member  with a material including lightalloy and has a groove c opposed to the groove c and axially extended The columnar member  has elastic modulus smaller than elastic modulus of the raceway member  and fitted to the grooves c cSELECTED DRAWING Figure
