 CNU According to the base structure of the steel plate spring support due to the fact that the base welded to the axle housing is of the Ushaped structure with the Hshaped transverse section and the Ushaped longitudinal section with the downward opening compared with an original square plane materials are reduced and therefore the material cost and the weight are reduced compared with an original square plane the machining area is reduced and the machining cost is reduced
