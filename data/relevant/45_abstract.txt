The invention discloses a control method for improving flexible DC power transmission AC side fault ridethrough capability The method comprises the steps the mathematical model of the upper and lower bridge arms of a modular multilevel converter station is established through mathematical modeling by using equivalent capacitance with variable capacitance the analytic relationship between therealtime power value of the ACDC side of MMC converter station and the voltage value of the DC side of the MMC converter station is obtained according to the mathematical model the relationship between the imbalance degree between AC and DC side power of the converter station and the DC side voltage sag is deduced according to the analytic relationship and then the realtime target value of converter station power adjustment is determined according to the relationship The ACDC side power imbalance degree of the converter station is obviously reduced the power adjustment pressure of theexisting outer loop power control and the inner loop current control is reduced the control effect of the existing control strategy is indirectly improved and the stability of the DC voltage can be greatly improved
