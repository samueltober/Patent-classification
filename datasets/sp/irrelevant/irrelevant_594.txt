 CNB The invention discloses a suspension automatic control method and system used for vehicle collision avoidance The method comprises the steps that firstly a system is standby secondly a sensing module  monitors the obstacles in front of a vehicle thirdly when a TTC meets the first early warning preset threshold value the fourth step is executed otherwise monitoring continues fourthlyan active suspension module  adjusts the suspension stroke and the front and back suspension damping force fifthly when the TTC meets the second early warning preset threshold value the sixth step is executed otherwise the seventh step is executed sixthly an active brake module  actively pressurizes and brakes until the TTC is increased to the outside of the second early warning preset threshold value range or braking is carried out and the eighth step is executed seventhly the active suspension module recovers to the state before receiving a collision early warning signal andeighthly the system becomes silent and the first step is executed During collision early warning the suspension damping force and the stroke are automatically adjusted to the optimal brake response state the posture in vehicle brake is kept the brake distance is reduced the collision is prevented and the brake comfort is improved
