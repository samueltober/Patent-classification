The invention discloses a current frequency conversion circuit with a selfadaptive multithreshold comparison function The current frequency conversion circuit comprises an integrating circuit a multithreshold comparison circuit a constant current source a switching circuit and an interface circuit the integrating circuit converts an input current signal into a voltage signal in real time and inputs the voltage signal to the multithreshold comparison circuit the multithreshold comparison circuit compares judges and compensates the voltage value output by the integrating circuit andthe voltage change trend and outputs a converted frequency signal to the interface circuit the interface circuit is used for converting and outputting output signals and when the switching circuitjudges that the charges output by the integrating circuit are balanced the constant current source is controlled to reversely charge the integrating circuit until the output voltage of the integrating circuit meets the judgment requirement of the multithreshold comparison circuit The current frequency conversion circuit with the selfadaptive multithreshold comparison function provided by theinvention overcomes the defects that the existing current frequency conversion sampling rate is low and the precision is difficult to improve and can be applied to occasions with higher requirementson the current frequency conversion precision
