 KRB     The present invention relates to an encoder seal assembly for sealing between an outer ring and an inner ring of a hub bearing for a vehicle to which an encoder for detecting the rotational speed of an axle is coupled the direction of the flow of the main lip formed with a plurality of contact protrusions and incoming foreign matter It has a labyrinth lip that guides in the inflow direction of the foreign material keeping the contact stress at the main lip constant according to the pressure of the incoming foreign material minimizing friction loss of the seal assembly and preventing foreign matter from leaking inside By improving the sealing properties and reducing the error value generated in the existing encoder relates to an encoder seal assembly capable of high quality measurement
