 KRB The present invention relates to a vehicle drive axle with a drag torque reduction function and particularly to a vehicle drive axle which enhances performance of a seal to eliminate an auxiliary lip of the seal for reducing drag torque by extending the length of an end portion of a boot and simultaneously making a portion of one side of a knuckle protrude to close the inside of a wheel bearing from the outside The vehicle drive axle including the boot the knuckle and the wheel bearing comprises the boot having a sealing unit performing a covering operation to prevent foreign materials from flowing toward the wheel bearing by having one end portion long extended in the radial direction of the drive axle and the knuckle provided with a protrusion unit formed to be stepped in the centripetal direction of the drive axle so that a gap is formed between the protrusion unit and the sealing unit of the boot and a foreign material pooling recess formed to be in connection to the inner side of the protrusion unit for filtering and holding induced foreign materials through the sealing unit
