 CNA A highfrequencyresponse chassis antirollover control system adjusted through resistance and an antirollover control method belong to the technical field of vehicle engineering the system is formed by connecting a shock absorber a main control unit a sensor and an adjustable load resistor the system is scientific the control logic is clear and through the cooperation of a gear rack transmission mechanism and a motor good trafficability and riding comfort are obtained by changing the value of the adjustable resistor the suspension system shock absorber is combined with semiactive control and active control it is guaranteed that the automobile does not roll over to the maximum extent by changing the value of the adjustable resistor and the system is suitable for pavements with various attachment conditions The system is especially suitable for pavements with poor adhesion conditions
