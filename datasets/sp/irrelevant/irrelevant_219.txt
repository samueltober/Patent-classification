 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To make it possible to estimate the height of the centerofmass on a spring with higher precision even when the arrangement and mass of a load change variously and the height of the center of gravity of the load changesSOLUTION A centerofmass height estimation device  comprises a roll moment calculation unit  for calculating a roll moment Mon a spring in a vehicle on the basis of the bearing capacity of left and right suspensions provided to the vehicle a horizontal acceleration measurement unit  for measuring a horizontal acceleration G which is the acceleration in the width direction of the vehicle a mass measurement unit  for measuring a mass on the spring a transfer function calculation unit  for calculating a transfer function F of the roll moment Mto the horizontal acceleration G and a centerofmass height calculation unit  for dividing the gain of the transfer function F by the mass on the spring to thereby calculate the height from the roll center of the vehicle to the centerofmass on the springSELECTED DRAWING Figure
