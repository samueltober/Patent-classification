The invention discloses a middlehigh voltage power supply quality unified regulator containing a distributed energy storage unit The regulator comprises an alternating current power grid access end an input switch a phaseshifting transformer n threephase rectifiers an MMC modular multilevel converter an output switch a load access end and a bypass switch wherein six bridge arms of the MMC consist of cascaded composite submodules SM the composite submodule SM is composed of an MMC submodule and an energy storage module The n secondary threephase windings of the phaseshifting transformer are connected to the alternatingcurrent input ends of the n threephase rectifiers in a onetoone correspondence mode directcurrent output ends of the n threephase rectifiers are connected to the directcurrent end of the MMC converter in a cascaded mode and a load voltage is output through the MMC converter so the number of the phaseshifting transformer windings and the number of the threephase rectifiers are greatly reduced and the energy storage module can independently supply power to the load through a cascade bridge formed by three upper bridge arms and three lower bridge arms of the MMC converter so transmission efficiency of the system is improved
