 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of automobile shock absorption in particular to a shock absorber a shock absorption system and a vehicle The shock absorber comprises a piston mechanism a working cylinder a first cylinder barrel and a second pressure storing cylinder the piston mechanism comprises a piston cylinder the piston cylinder is movably arranged in a cylinder cavity ofthe working cylinder the piston cylinder divides the cylinder cavity of the working cylinder into an upper cavity and a lower cavity the lower cavity communicates with the cylinder cavity of the second pressure storing cylinder the working cylinder is provided with a first stripshaped flow area and the piston cylinder is provided with a second stripshaped flow area when the piston cylindermoves in the working cylinder the onoff state between the upper cavity the first cylinder barrel and the lower cavity can be changed the first stripshaped flow area is provided with a oneway damping structure to produce damping when fluid flows from the first cylinder barrel to the lower cavity of the working cylinder The damping effect of the shock absorber can be ensured and adjustment isfacilitated when the movement stroke of the piston cylinder is increased
