 CNA The invention discloses a reactive compensation and singlephase earth fault arc extinguishing system and method for a lowcurrent grounding system The system comprises an arc extinguishing control device and a threephase starconnected multilevel converter The input end of the arc extinguishing control device inputs bus threephase voltage zerosequence voltage and zerosequence current of each branch and the output end of the arc extinguishing control device sends a control signal to the multilevel converter The multilevel converter receives the control signal and outputs a specific voltage vector Meanwhile the invention further discloses an arc extinguishing method of the system According to the invention the voltage to ground of the fault phase voltage is controlled to be zero the arc extinction of the grounding fault can be rapidly realized the cable at the grounding position is prevented from being burnt by arc light and personal electric shock casualty accidents areavoided the system after the singlephase grounding fault does not need to trip immediately and continuously and safely operates for a period of time and the reliability and safety of the system are greatly improved
