 USB A wheel bearing apparatus has a magnetic encoder  mounted on an inner ring  opposing the rotational speed sensor  via the cap  and an air gap The cap  has a cylindrical fitting part a pressfit into an inner circumference of an end of the outer member  A shielding part c extends radially inward from the fitting part a and has an annular disc shape A detection part a of the rotational speed sensor  is arranged close to or in contact with a side surface of the shielding part c The cap  is formed of austenitic stainless steel sheet based on SUS  The carbon C content is reduced and the nickel Ni content is increased A difference of magnetic flux density between a martensitic transformation part and nonmartensite part is  mT or less
