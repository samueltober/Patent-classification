 CNU The utility model provides a vehiclemounted acceleration sensing device and a vehicle The vehiclemounted acceleration sensing device comprises an acceleration sensor an analogtodigital converterand an AB bus transceiver the acceleration sensor is connected with the analogtodigital converter and can detect the acceleration of the vehicle to obtain an acceleration analog signal and transmit the signal to the analogtodigital converter the analogtodigital converter is connected with the AB bus transceiver and can convert the acceleration analog signal into an acceleration digitalsignal and transmit the acceleration digital signal to the AB bus transceiver the AB bus transceiver is further connected with the vehiclemounted active noise reduction system through a vehiclemounted AB bus the AB bus transceiver receives the acceleration digital signal and then transmits the acceleration digital signal to the vehiclemounted active noise reduction system through the vehiclemounted AB bus and the vehiclemounted active noise reduction system carries out noise reduction processing according to the acceleration digital signal According to the scheme the strict lowtimedelay requirement of the vehiclemounted active noise reduction system can be met the problems that sensors required by the vehiclemounted active noise reduction system need to cover a vehiclebody in an omnibearing mode the number of the required sensors is large and therefore wiring pressure is large are solved and cost is reduced
