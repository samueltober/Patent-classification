The invention discloses a multiphase converter and a control circuit and a control method thereof The multiphase converter comprises multiphase power stage circuits connected in parallel between an input end and an output end and the on and off of a main switching tube of each phase of power stage circuit are controlled by a switching signal of a corresponding phase The control circuit comprises a multicorrelation cutoff timing circuit a multiphase switch control circuit and a multiphase frequency control circuit and each phase frequency control circuit is used for detecting the switching frequency of a switching signal of a corresponding phase and fixing the switching frequency of the switching signal at a corresponding reference frequency therefore the switching signal of each phase is kept working at a fixed reference frequency and phase shift and the ripple of the output voltage can be optimized through the superposition of multiphase inductive current
