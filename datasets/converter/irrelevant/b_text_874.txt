 CNU     The utility model discloses a system for adjusting the power supply voltage of a power amplifier based on a transmitter branch gain setting The system includes a radio frequency transceiver a boostbuck DCDC converter a radio frequency predistorter a power amplifier and a radio frequency transceiver Send an analog voltage signal to the stepupstepdown DCDC converter and control the stepupstepdown DCDC converter to output the corresponding power supply voltage value to the power amplifier the RF transceiver sends the RF excitation signal to the RF predistorter  And the radio frequency predistorter sends the processed radio frequency predistortion signal to the input end of the power amplifier The power amplifier amplifies the received radio frequency predistortion signal and part of the generated radio frequency amplified signal is sent to the antenna for transmission through the duplexer The other small part is fed back to the RF predistorter through the coupler and also fed back to the receiver input of the RF transceiver
