 CNU The utility model provides a damping mechanism The guide device comprises a guide cylinder a guide shaft two fastening pieces and an elastic piece the guide cylinder is used for connecting a chassis of the wheeled mobile robot the guide shaft penetrates through the guide cylinder and comprises a shaft body and a limiting part annularly arranged in the middle of the shaft body the two fasteners are connected to the two ends of the shaft body in a fastened mode respectively the elastic piece is contained in an inner cavity of the guide cylinder and arranged on the shaft body in a sleevingmode one end of the elastic piece abuts against the limiting part and the other end of the elastic piece abuts against the end face of the guide cylinder The utility model further provides a universal wheel set The utility model further provides a wheeled mobile robot According to the utility model the guide shaft and the elastic piece are matched with the guide cylinder according to the damping structure the whole structure is simplified the occupied space is small external force borne by the universal wheels is transmitted through the guide shafts vibration energy generated by the external force is absorbed through the elastic pieces then the damping purpose is achieved and therefore the problems that a damping structure cannot have a good damping effect and is small in occupied space are solved
