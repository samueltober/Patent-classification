 USB A bearing bushing for example for a motor vehicle The bearing bushing is switchable between a first and a second stiffness stage The bearing bushing has a first elastomer ring which is arranged rotationally fixedly on an outer circumferential surface of an inner ring and a second elastomer ring which is arranged rotationally fixedly on an inner circumferential surface of an outer ring Radially between the two elastomer rings an intermediate ring makes contact in a rotationally fixed manner with the two elastomer rings To change in stiffness of the bearing bushing the first elastomer ring can be bridged by the intermediate ring and at least one blocking ring which is arranged on the bearing bushing at an end side
