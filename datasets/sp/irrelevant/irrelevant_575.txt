 DEA     Bearing   for recording vehiclespecific data comprising a bearing body  formed at least partially from an elastomer the bearing body  being formed at least partially from a dielectric material and being arranged within the bearing  in such a way that mechanical vibrations acting on the bearing   in the dielectric material are induced to change a measurable electrical quantity on the basis of which the mechanical vibration processes acting on the bearing   can be detected the measurable electrical quantity being the electrical capacitance
