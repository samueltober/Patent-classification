 USB The disclosure relates to a touch andor proximity detection system having some components operating in the guard domain and other components operating in the earth or chassis ground domain A guard chip in the earth or chassis ground domain can include a voltage driver configured to produce a guard signal for example In some examples the guard signal can be coupled to one or more shielding electrodes of a touch screen and to the ground pin of one or more touch sensing chips of the touch andor proximity detection system In this way for example the touch sensing chips which can include sense amplifiers coupled to one or more sensing electrodes of the touch screen can operate in the guard domain In some examples the guard chip can further include differential amplifiers andor ADCs allowing these components to operate in the earth or chassis ground domain
