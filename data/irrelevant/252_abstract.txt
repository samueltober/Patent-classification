The invention relates to an intermediate frequency AC bus convergencebased wind power plant DC transmission grid access method and belongs to the technical field of wind power transmission and gridconnection According to the method threephase intermediatefrequency mediumvoltage AC power of a plurality of wind generator sets is transmitted to an intermediatefrequency AC convergence bus through a plurality of intermediatefrequency AC power transmission lines is transmitted to an intermediatefrequency boosting transformer of a converter station to be converted into threephase intermediatefrequency highvoltage AC power is converted into highvoltage DC power through an intermediatefrequency modularized multilevel current converter is transmitted to a powerfrequency highvoltage current converter through a DC power transmission line to be converted to threephase powerfrequency highvoltage AC power and is connected into a powerfrequency AC grid According to the method a wind power plant is changed from powerfrequency AC convergence to intermediatefrequency AC convergence so that the intermediatefrequency transformer can have smaller volume and weight The cost volume and weight of the intermediatefrequency modularized multilevel current converter is greatly reduced and the wind power plant DC power transmission systems are lower in cost and high incompact degree
