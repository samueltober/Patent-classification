A multistage power converter  includes a firststage power conversion circuit  a secondstage power conversion circuit  a secondstage analogic sampler  a pulse width modulator  a first isolator  a pulse width analyzer  and a control unit  The secondstage analogic sampler  samples power parameter from the secondstage power conversion circuit  The pulse width modulator  converts the power parameter into a pulse width modulation signal The pulse width analyzer  receives the pulse width modulation signal through the first isolator  in an isolation manner calculates a duty ratio of the pulse width modulation signal according to a rising edge and a falling edge of the pulse width modulation signal and calculates the power parameter according to the duty ratio The control unit  controls operations of the secondstage power conversion circuit  according to the power parameter that is obtained by the pulse width analyzer
