 USB A flanged inner ring and methods of forming the same having a rolling edge configured to preload axially a radially inner ring of a rolling bearing after being plastically deformed the rolling edge including a diameter of increasing variable size along an axis X of symmetry of the flanged inner ring and wherein the increasing variable size increases along the axis X in a direction away from the radially inner ring and the rolling edge includes an outer preloading surface configured such that in a deformed configuration the outer preloading surface is arranged against the radially inner ring and such that in an undeformed configuration the outer preloading surface is inclined away from the axis X of symmetry of the flanged inner ring
