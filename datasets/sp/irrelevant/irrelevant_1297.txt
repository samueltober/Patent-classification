 CNU The utility model provides an air suspension type bracket assembly Under the action of the dehydration mechanism the motor can drive the rotating roller to rotate the rotating roller can drive thesecond conveying belt to move the bearing plate can be pushed to move downwards through the air cylinder the bearing plate pushes the second conveying belt to move downwards the first conveying belt is extruded through the second conveying belt and sludge conveyed on the surface of the first conveying belt can be extruded and dewatered According to the utility model the structure is simplewhen the bracket body is extruded by an external force the bracket body upwards extrudes the arcshaped supporting plate the arcshaped supporting plate moves upwards in the sliding groove through the sliding block Extrusion cushioning spring through the elastic characteristics of the cushioning springs the vibration feeling of the bracket body can be effectively relieved so that the devicehas better cushioning capacity frequent telescopic operation of the suspension bodies on the two sides of the Cshaped seat plate due to the fact that the Cshaped seat plate is driven by external force to move frequently is prevented the working frequency of the suspension bodies is reduced and the service life of the suspension bodies is prolonged
