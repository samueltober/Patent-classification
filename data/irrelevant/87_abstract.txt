The invention relates to a method for operating a modular multilevel power converter having a plurality of power converter branches in each of which series circuits of bridge modules are arranged wherein the bridge modules each have a bridge circuit in the form of a halfbridge or a fullbridge of power semiconductors and at least one capacitor which can be connected via the bridge circuit wherein the method provides an output AC voltage at an output frequency on an output side of the power converter wherein the desired temporal amplitude profile of the output AC voltage of the power converter is synthesized with a modulation frequency by means of a modulation AC voltage produced by the bridge modules of one or more power converter branches which modulation frequency is higher than the output frequency wherein the modulation AC voltage alternately exceeds and falls below the output AC voltage in time with the modulation frequency and an energy controller assigned to a power converter branch in each case controls the switching times of the power semiconductors of the bridge modules in this power converter branch with the control objective of minimizing the energy variation of the power converter branch The invention also relates to a modular multilevel power converter designed in this manner and to a computer program having program code means set up to carry out a method of the type mentioned above
