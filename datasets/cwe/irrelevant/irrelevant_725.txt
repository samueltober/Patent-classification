 USB A hub bearing unit includes an inner ring having inboard and outboard axial ends and a bearing inner race on an outer surface An outer ring disposed about the inner ring has inboard and outboard axial ends and a bearing outer race on an inner surface One ring is coupled with a wheel and rotatable about an axis and the other ring is fixedly coupled with a frame A plurality of rolling elements is rollable upon the inner and outer races A displacement limiter extends radially from one ring and has a frustoconical stop surface spaced radially from a surface of the other ring The limiter stop surface engages with the ring surface when the ring displaces radially andor axially relative to the other ring to prevent brinelling impacts on the bearing races Preferably the displacement limiter is located axially between the rolling elements and the ring inboard ends
