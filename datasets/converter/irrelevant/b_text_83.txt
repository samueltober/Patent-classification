 USB An efficient solution to the problem of converting alternating signals into a plurality of signals having different signal characteristics in observation of different application requirements This is achieved by a multiple input multiple output converter operated at a secondary side of an inductive power transfer system for converting at least one alternating input signal into a rectified alternating input signal and a further signal derived by averaging a switched voltage generated during rectification of the alternating input signal The multiple input multiple output converter comprises at least one rectifier circuit adapted to rectify the alternating input signal and at least one averaging circuit adapted to average the switched voltage which is generated during rectification operation of the eat least one alternating input signal
