 CNU A driving servo suspension device for an automobile is characterized in that the suspension device is connected with a frame and a cleat a servo motor can adjust the suspension distance of the cleat the servo motor rotates to control the movement of a push rod in a servo electric cylinder and the movement of the push rod controls the adjustment of the distance between a damping spring and the cleat and the elastic force release speed of the spring According to the driving servo suspension device of the automobile the adjustment of the distance between tires fixed by the driving part and the ground and the elastic force release adjustment of the damping spring are realized and the precise rotating speed control the precise thrust control and the precise torque control of the servo motor are converted into the precise speed control the precise position control and the precise thrust control of the cylinder body so that the driving servo suspension device of the automobile is higher in precision an existing automobile active suspension can be replaced the manufacturing cost is low collision throwing and downward pulling caused to an automobile body when a traditional passive hydraulic suspension passes through a deceleration strip and updown jerking feeling after the automobile body falls to the ground are avoided and the driving comfort and safety are comprehensively improved
