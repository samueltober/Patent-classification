 WOA The invention relates to a seal assembly  for a wheel bearing  of a motor vehicle comprising a seal retainer  which delimits a pressure chamber  the seal retainer  having an inlet channel  that can communicate with a pressure source and with the pressure chamber  and an outlet channel  that can communicate with the pressure chamber  and with a pressure useful space and comprising a seal unit  arranged substantially coaxially to an axis of rotation  of the wheel bearing  for establishing a sealing contact with a sealing partner  that can be rotated relative to the seal retainer  The seal unit  delimits an axial end face of the pressure chamber  and can be moved relative to the seal retainer  in the axial direction andor is elastically deformable The flow crosssection of the outlet channel  is dimensioned in such a way that when a pressure fluid is conveyed from the pressure source to the pressure useful space in the pressure chamber  a back pressure for sealingly pressing the seal unit  against the sealing partner  is caused Thus with low wear a rotary feedthrough  for a wheel bearing  having low leakage is enabled
