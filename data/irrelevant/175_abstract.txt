A DCtoDC converter converts a DC input voltage to a DC output voltage by generating a primary AC voltage and transforming the primary AC voltage into a secondary AC voltage with a transformation ratio The DCtoDC converter has series resonance circuit for each AC voltage phase When the ratio of the DC output voltage to the DC input direct voltage is greater than the transformation ratio a phase shift between the primary alternating voltage and a series resonance circuit current corresponding to the primary alternating voltage is controlled to zero by changing a clocking frequency clocking the AC voltages Conversely when the ratio of the DC output voltage to the DC input voltage is less than the transformation ratio the phase shift between the secondary AC voltage and a series resonance circuit current corresponding to the secondary AC voltage is controlled to zero by changing a clocking frequency
