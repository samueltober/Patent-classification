A power conversion system includes at least one multilevel power converter and a controller coupled to the at least one multilevel power converter The controller includes a first CMV injection module  and a second CMV injection module  The first CMV injection module  generates a first CMV signal  for modifying at least one voltage command  to achieve a first function in association with operation of the power conversion system The second CMV injection module  generates a second CMV signal  based at least in part on a local limit either for modifying the at least one voltage command  or for further modifying the at least one modified voltage command  to achieve a second function in association with operation of the power conversion system
