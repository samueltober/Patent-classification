 USB A hub bearing unit includes an inner ring having inboard and outboard axial ends and a bearing inner race on an outer surface An outer ring is disposed about the inner ring and has inboard and outboard axial ends and a bearing outer race on an inner surface One ring is coupled with a wheel and is rotatable about an axis and the other ring is fixedly coupled with a vehicle An annular displacement limiter extends radially outwardly from the inner ring and has a radial stop surface spaced axially from the inboard end of the outer ring The stop surface engages with the outer ring end when one ring displaces axially relative to the other ring Preferably the limiter is integrally formed with an annular insert providing a bearing inner race but may be separately formed and disposed about the insert or the inner ring outer surface
