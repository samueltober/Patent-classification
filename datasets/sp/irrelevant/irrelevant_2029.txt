 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To realize a structure capable of preventing an excessive unbalanced load from being applied to a support fixing portion with respect to a vehicle body    SOLUTION A pair of drive shafts a and b are coaxial with each other and their respective tip portions are oriented in opposite directions with respect to a direction orthogonal to a swing shaft  arranged substantially parallel to a road surface  Supports the housing  rotatably and enables swinging around the swing shaft  The output shafts of the pair of electric motors a and b are arranged noncoaxially with each other and parallel to each other with their tips facing in opposite directions The rotational torque of the output shafts a and b of the pair of electric motors a and b is increased by the pair of torque transmission devices a and b respectively and is transmitted to the pair of drive shafts a and b respectively
