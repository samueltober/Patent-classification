 CNB The invention relates to a hub reduction electric driving system with a trailing arm threeconnectingrod suspension One end of a trailing arm is movably connected to a frame a first control arm is movably connected with the trailing arm and the frame a second control arm is movably connected with the trailing arm and the frame a third control arm is movably connected with the trailing arm and the frame a motor shell and a reduction gearbox shell are integrated to be used as the trailing arm in the trailing arm threeconnectingrod suspension so as to form an integrated trailing arm assembly structure the center of mass of a motor is placed in a position close to the frame and during speed reduction driving an output shaft on the motor is used as an input shaft of a reduction gearbox the power is output by an output shaft of the reduction gearbox and the trailing arm threeconnectingrod suspension controls the camber angle and toein angle of a wheel in the jumping process therefore a tire is kept in a vertical manner in the running process Compared with the prior art the hub reduction electric driving system with the trailing arm threeconnectingrod suspension has the advantages of high integration degree small equivalent unsprung mass stable camber angle and toein angle equal force borne on the suspension system and so on
