 KRA The present invention relates to a switching system for tracking the maximum power point of a solar power generation system According to the present invention the switching system for tracking the maximum power point of a solar power generation system comprises a solar cell array which produces energy through sunlight a first performing unit which receives power through sunlight and performs maximum power point tracking MPPT according to whether it exceeds a reference voltage and a second performing unit which receives energy through the solar cell array and performs MPPT according to whether it exceeds the reference voltage The present invention has the effect of preventing a discontinuous section from occurring even if an MPPT mode is switched according to the reference voltage due to the fluctuation of a solar cell voltage
