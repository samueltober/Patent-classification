 CNB The invention discloses an AGV suspension system elastic adjustment method based on depth reinforcement learning A plurality of elastic units with adjustable elasticity controlled by a motor are respectively installed on a wheel bottom plate of an AGV trolley The method includes collecting IMU data stream acquiring acceleration data in vertical direction and drawing curve a t determining whether the equivalent elastic coefficient needs to be adjusted when the signal of motor intervention control is received the adjustment action is calculated by neural network algorithm Through the algorithm processing control the motor adjust the position of the slider on the screw rod thereby controlling the spring compression The invention adopts the depth deterministic strategy gradient algorithm to learn the selfadaptive change control law of the equivalent elastic coefficient of the elastic combined unit and takes the neural network as a carrier according to the sensors perception of the current elastic units softness and hardness automatically calculates the output of each spring screw motor and realizes the automatic control of the elastic coefficient change of the elastic unit
