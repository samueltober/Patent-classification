 CNU The utility model discloses an evaporator which comprises an evaporation separation tank which is divided into a bottom evaporation area and an upper condensation area the bottom evaporation area isprovided with an inlet and an outlet and the upper condensation area is provided with a discharge port the heating device is used for heating the mixed liquid to generate evaporated gas the condensing device is used for condensing the boiloff gas generated by the mixed liquid and generating condensed liquid and the jet flow vacuum device creates a vacuum environment for the evaporation separation tank by applying the Venturi effect The jet flow vacuum device has the advantages that the problems that a vacuum device matched with an existing evaporator is single in function many in neededmatched parts large in occupied space and high in production and later use cost are fully considered the jet flow vacuum device for achieving the vacuumizing effect through the Venturi effect is simple in configuration and the production and maintenance cost can be effectively reduced
