The invention relates to a power gridoriented energy storage power station site selection and constant volume optimization method under a market mechanism Starting from energy storage oriented to apower grid cost benefits of energy storage participating in a power market are analyzed from two aspects of direct income and indirect income and on the basis an energy storage optimal configuration multitarget doublelayer planning model comprehensively considering planning and operation is established The outer layer takes energy storage side comprehensive benefits conventional unit side operation benefits new energy side additional grid connection benefits and power grid side grid loss benefits as targets the innerlayer target is energy storage and the coordinated operation cost of new energy and a conventional unit is minimum By means of the mode planning and operation are combined together based on doublelayer decision energy storage site selection and constant volume the influence of the charging and discharging strategy of energy storage on the cycle life is considered operation guidance planning is achieved and a new thought is provided for application of energystorage to an electric power system
