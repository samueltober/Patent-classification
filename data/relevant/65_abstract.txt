The invention discloses a submodule temperature adjusting and balancing method based on centralized control of a modular multilevel converter The method comprises the steps collecting the temperature and bridge arm current of a radiator of each submodule the capacitor voltage of each submodule on a bridge arm and a switching function calculating the average junction temperature of each submodule according to the acquired data and calculating the virtual voltage bias coefficient of each submodule according to the average junction temperature calculating the virtual capacitor voltageof each submodule according to the virtual voltage bias coefficient of each submodule performing ascending sorting on the submodules in the bridge arm according to the virtual capacitor voltage and establishing a submodule index list determining the number of the submodules needing to be conducted in real time by modulating the reference signal and determining the submodules needing to be conducted in real time according to the submodule index table and the bridge arm current direction so temperature balance of the submodules in the bridge arm is achieved The method is not limited by the number of submodules does not affect the gridconnected power quality of the converter is simple in control algorithm and is easy to understand and implement
