 WOA The invention relates to a steerable individual wheel suspension  which is designed as a steerable double transverse link suspension  for a motor vehicle  The individual wheel suspension  has at least one upper transverse link  and at least one lower transverse link  wherein one end of the upper transverse link  is operatively connected to a wheel carrier  in an articulated manner in an upper kinematic point  and one end of the lower transverse link  is operatively connected to the wheel carrier  in an articulated manner in a lower kinematic point  said two kinematic points   simultaneously defining a straight steering axis  about which the wheel carrier  can be pivoted in order to steer the motor vehicle  The individual wheel suspension  additionally has a spring  for cushioning relative movements between the chassis  and wheelguiding components of the individual wheel suspension  such as the wheel carrier  and the transverse links   for example The invention is characterized in that the spring  has a spring axis  which is at least substantially congruent with the steering axis
