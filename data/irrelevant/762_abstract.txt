The invention discloses a power imbalance control method of a cascaded Hbridge photovoltaic gridconnected inverter belongs to the field of photovoltaic power generation and aims to solve the problem that a system cannot operate stably due to serious power imbalance of transmission power between singlephase cascaded Hbridge photovoltaic gridconnected inverter modules The method comprises the following steps of controlling the directcurrent bus capacitor voltages of all Hbridge converters to enable a photovoltaic module corresponding to an Hbridge converter of which the modulation degree is not greater than pi works at a maximum power point and enabling the output power of the photovoltaic module corresponding to the Hbridge of which the modulation degree is greater than pito be equal to the maximum power which can be actually transmitted by the Hbridge performing nostaticerror control on the power grid current according to different working modes of the system adopting different modulation waves to calculate modulation waves of all H bridges Compared with the prior art when the modulation degree of some Hbridge converters is larger than pi the system can still operate normally and the capacity of the singlephase cascaded Hbridge photovoltaic gridconnected inverter for coping with power imbalance is greatly improved
