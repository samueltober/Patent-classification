The invention discloses an energy management method based on a building which comprises the following steps of filtering waste water andor water vapor in a building respectively storing according to the temperature enabling a hightemperature storage area to be positioned underground the building enabling a lowtemperature storage area to be positioned at the top of the building and if the temperature of the filtered waste water andor water vapor is greater than a first preset value determining that the waste water andor water vapor is a hightemperature waste fluid and storing the hightemperature waste water andor water vapor and if the temperature of the filtered waste water andor water vapor is lower than or equal to a first preset value determining as a lowtemperature waste fluid Energy recovery is conducted on the hightemperature waste fluid in a waste heat power generation mode when the temperature of the hightemperature waste fluid is reduced and is smaller than the first preset value the hightemperature waste fluid is stored in a lowtemperature area and energy acting on the lowtemperature waste fluid is preferably from energy stored in waste heat power generation
