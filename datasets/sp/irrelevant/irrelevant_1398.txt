 JPA To provide an unmanned carrier with a simple structure having a lock function which can fix an attitude of a vehicle body while travel is stopped and can perform loading and unloading with respect to a load carrying platformSOLUTION An independent suspension mechanism includes a linear guide guide support mechanism  for movably guiding a wheel holding frame  for supporting an axle  of a wheel  only in a vertical direction to a vehicle body  against resilient force by a cylindrical coil spring resilient means  and a lock mechanism  switchable between a lock release state and a lock state in which movement of the wheel holding frame  in the vertical direction is inhibited By a cushioning function by the independent suspension mechanism  an unmanned carrier is configured to stabilize an attitude during travel of the vehicle body  installed with a load carrying platform inhibit movement of the wheel holding frame  in the vertical direction by the lock mechanism  during travel is stopped fix the attitude of the vehicle body  in a travel stop state and perform loading and unloading to the load carrying platformSELECTED DRAWING Figure
