 KRA The present invention relates to a lowfriction bush of a stabilizer bar for a vehicle using a crosslinked film Specifically the present invention enables relative motion with a bracket by integrally applying a bearing to the outer surface of a rubber bush and reduces abrasion resistance by minimizing friction in the rotational direction of the rubber bush by applying a low friction film and a lubricant layer to a bearing surface where contact with the bracket occurs thereby improving the stability of riding comport and improving maneuverability
