 CNA     The invention relates to the technical field of automobile active suspension control and specifically relates to a reference modelbased inversion control method for an active suspension Firstly a dynamic model of a  vehicle twodegreeoffreedom active suspension test bench is established secondly it is based on a ceiling Underground damping control method establishes an ideal passive control suspension system model and uses it as a reference model for subsequent backstepping control design then uses the output of the reference model under road excitation as a reference signal and designs a model based on Lyapunov theory The model refers to the backstepping control algorithm and applies it to active damping control to achieve an approximation of the ideal passive suspension systems damping performance Finally a typical road excitation form is selected to verify the active vibration reduction control method The inversion control strategy based on the reference model can effectively restrain the vertical motion of the vehicle body reduce the vertical acceleration of the vehicle body and at the same time reduce the tire deformation to a certain extent and improve the cars ride comfort and driving stability
