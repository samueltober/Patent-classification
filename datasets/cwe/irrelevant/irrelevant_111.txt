 CNU A hub bearing fastening structure comprises a wheel axle a tapered roller bearing and a round nut the round nut is connected with the wheel axle through a threaded connection structure bearing pretightening torque is adjusted the end of the wheel axle is connected with a gland through a bolt one side of the gland is attached to the end face of the round nut in a pressed mode and the round nut is prevented from being stressed to retreat The end of the wheel shaft is of a step structure and one side of the gland is of a step type sinking table structure so that an inner hole of a sinking table step of the gland is matched with the outer wall of an end step of the wheel shaft to limit the axial direction of the gland The hub bearing pretightening device has the advantages that thepretightening torque of the hub bearing is adjusted through the round nut to reach a design required value then the gland is fixedly installed on the wheel axle through the bolt and tightly pressesthe round nut the round nut is prevented from loosening and retreating and then the locking plate is clamped on the bolt According to the scheme the pretightening torque of the hub bearing can be adjusted to a design required value at a time installation and adjustment are convenient axial machining dimensional tolerance control over parts is not very tight and the production cost is reduced
