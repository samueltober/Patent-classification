 CNB The invention provides an active suspension control method a system equipment and storage medium The method comprises steps that a signal sent by an electronic brake controller is monitored if the electronic brake controller is in a normal state and an electronic hand brake is in an open state the electronic brake controller is used to send a brake request signal to a suspension controllerthe control strategy of the front suspension actuating force Ff and the rear suspension actuating force Fr of the vehicle are acquired according to the vehicle condition parameters the suspension controller is used to execute the control strategy to adjust the front suspension and the rear suspension of the vehicle and the execution of the control strategy meets the condition that the vertical load transfer amount of the vehicle is smaller than a first load transfer amount threshold value after the active supercharging and decelerating function is triggered The control method of the invention is advantageous in that signals are sent to the suspension controller by additionally providing the electronic brake controller the suspension controller is used to receive the signals to the front and the rear suspension of the vehicle before the vehicle is really pressurized and decelerated and the front and the rear suspension of the vehicle are controlled to be powered according to a certain control strategy so that the abrupt feeling caused by the deceleration of the vehicle is reduced and the braking efficiency is effectively improved
