 EPB The invention discloses an output type multibearingpoint independent suspension which comprises an upper fork arm a lower fork arm elastic elements a shock absorber and fork arm positioning pivots the upper fork arm and the lower fork arm are Ashaped structural parts the front ends of the upper fork arm and the lower fork arm are respectively connected with the upper suspension point and lower suspension point of a wheel through main pins and the rear ends of the upper fork arm and the lower fork arm are connected with a vehicle frame through the elastic elements the shock absorber is mounted on top of the front end of the upper fork arm According to the present application appropriate bearing pivot points and transmission parts of the vehicle frame are constructed on peripheries of the upper fork arm and the lower fork arm By utilizing the lever principle the torsion bar principle and the principle of moments the double fork arm shaft hanging point motion can absorb bearing elastic forces by means of changing directions of force and the arms of force so as to form multiple points supporting a plurality of elastic elements such that the force applied on the wheel is distributed by multiple points and average running speed is thereby increased Increase in the number of the elastic elements and appropriate arrangement of the elastic elements can reduce the height of a vehicle optimize space utilization and improve the stability and running smoothness of the vehicle
