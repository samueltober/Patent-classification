 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a hub unit which can suppress the torsion of a flange of a hub wheel without increasing a manufacturing costSOLUTION A hub unit  comprises an outer ring  fixed to a knuckle  a hub wheel  having a wheel attachment flange  to which a wheel  is attached a plurality of rolling bodies  which are arranged between the outer ring  and the hub wheel  and a plurality of hub bolts  which are pressureinserted into a plurality of bolt penetration holes  formed at the wheel attachment flange  The wheel attachment flange  has a heavy thickness part  and a thin thickness part  and when viewing the wheel attachment false  from a side opposite to an attachment face a an outer edge of the heavy thickness part  is formed at an external peripheral end edge of the wheel attachment flange  within a range in which the bolt penetration holes  are formed and between a pair of the bolt penetration holes  which adjoin each other in a peripheral direction of the wheel attachment flange  the outer edge is formed outside a radial direction rather than a linear line for connecting bolt hole centers a of the bolt penetration holes SELECTED DRAWING Figure
