The present disclosure eliminates the unwanted conduction of a body diode of a low side switch or the unwanted conduction of the low side switch in coupled phases of DCDC converters operating in DCMto increase efficiency Specifically in one implementation by detecting strong or weak coupling the present disclosure eliminates body diode conduction in strong coupling by turning on the low sideswitch and eliminates negative body diode current in weak coupling by turning off the low side switch Further for multiphase switching DCDC converters with coupled inductors operating at light load ie in DCM when a high side switch of a first phase is turned on the body diode of a low side switch of a second phase is adaptively bypassed if needed blocked by specific design or prevented from conducting by reducing forward voltage across the body diode
