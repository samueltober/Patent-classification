 CNA     The invention discloses an active damping control method for a bidirectional DCDC converter of a direct current microgrid which belongs to the field of direct current microgrid Including the establishment of DC microgrid model simplification of DC microgrid model establishment of small signal model signal measurement active damping control and calculation of duty cycle The invention adopts a virtual resistance control method to perform impedance reshaping and reduces the amplitude of the output impedance of the bidirectional DCDC converter to be much smaller than the output impedance of the load converter The low frequency amplitude of the output impedance is not changed the hardware circuit is not increased the loss is not increased the power flow distribution of the system is not changed and the stability of the DC microgrid is improved which is conducive to the safe and stable operation of the DC microgrid
