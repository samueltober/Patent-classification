The invention discloses an AC fault positioning method applied to a fourterminal wind power DC power grid and the method comprises the steps S detecting the DC port voltage of each converter station judging that an AC fault happens to a receiving end converter station of the wind power DC power grid if the DC voltage exceeds a normal operation threshold value going to S and otherwise continuing to carry out the detection S calculating power flow transfer entropies HOL and HOL of the line  and the line  if the difference value delta HOL of the power flow transfer entropies of the line  and the line  is smaller than  judging that the power grid side converter station GSMMC has an alternating current fault and going to the step S if delta HOL is larger than deltaHth judging that the power grid side converter station GSMMC has an alternating current fault going to the step S wherein delta Hth is an upper limit threshold value and S switching on the energy consumption resistor device absorbing unbalanced power in the system fault period and making the system to return to normal operation Thus the alternating current fault position of the wind power direct current power grid can be quickly and accurately positioned and the proposed fault positioning method has few detection indexes is simple and convenient to calculate and does not need setting calculation
