 CNU A drivebywire chassis platform applied to unmanned fulldegreeoffreedom steering comprises a suspension system installed between a vehicle frame and a driving system and the driving system comprises four hub motor belt tire assemblies installed below the suspension system four wheels are independently steered through the four steering motors the steering motors conduct speed reduction and torque increase through the speed reducers the control precision and torque are improved and steering control is conducted on the four wheels through the chassis controller and the motor controller according to the steering angle of the whole vehicle The four wheels are connected without fixed mechanical structures and the steering angles of the four wheels are adjusted and controlled by the controller so that the functions of small steering radius zero steering radius and even transverse driving of the whole vehicle can be realized the flexibility of the whole vehicle is greatly improved and the application range is expanded
