 JPB To provide a structure of a rolling bearing unit for support of wheel in which a rotation angle of a hub with respect to an outer ring can be detectedSOLUTION On an axial inner side surface of a displacement sensor substrate  which is fitted to an axial inner side of a hub  plural displacement sensors are located on a virtual circle with a point on a central axis Oof the hub  as a center in the state that phases thereof with respect to a circumferential direction are deviated from one another Further a circular wheelshaped detected part  having conductivity is fitted to an axial outer side surface of a bottom plate part  which covers a cover  in the state that a central axis Oof itself is decentered with respect to the central axis Oof the hub  Detection parts of the plural displacement sensors are so made as to face the detected part  in an axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
