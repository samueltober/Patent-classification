 EPB Provided is a bearing device  for a wheel including an outer member  having doublerow outer raceway surfaces   formed on an inner circumference thereof an inner member  including a hub wheel  having a wheel mounting flange  formed thereon and at least one inner race  fitted to a smalldiameter step portion  formed on an outer circumference of the hub wheel  the inner member  having doublerow inner raceway surfaces   formed thereon so as to be opposed to the doublerow outer raceway surfaces   and a plurality of rolling elements   assembled into spaces between the doublerow outer raceway surfaces   and the doublerow inner raceway surfaces   the at least one inner race  being fixed in an axial direction thereof by a staked portion  formed by plastically deforming an end portion  of the smalldiameter step portion  of the hub wheel  radially outward the staked portion  having a face spline  formed on an end surface thereof by plastic working in which the following relationship is satisfied SM where M represents a mean diameter of an outer diameter B and an inner diameter C of the end portion  of the smalldiameter step portion  of the hub wheel  before the staked portion  is formed S represents an outer diameter of the face spline   represents a value indicating ductile elongation of a material for the hub wheel  in terms of proportion and  represents a correction coefficient depending on a type of process
