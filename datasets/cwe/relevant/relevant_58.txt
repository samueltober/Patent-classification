 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device allowing steerability of a vehicle to be improvedSOLUTION A bearing device  comprises raceway members   rolling elements  a pressing member  and a control part  The raceway member  has raceway surfaces   on the outer circumferential surface The raceway member  has raceway surfaces   on the inner circumferential surface The rolling elements   are in contact with the raceway surfaces     at a contact angle The pressing member  is disposed in one axialdirection end of the raceway member  The control part  identifies a pressing force from an input load according to a running state of a vehicle based on a predetermined correspondence relation and controls the pressing member  so as to press the raceway member  with the identified pressing force The correspondence relation is a relation in which the pressing force is determined according to the input load so that the relative inclination of the raceway members   changes linearly with a change of the input load to the bearing device SELECTED DRAWING Figure
