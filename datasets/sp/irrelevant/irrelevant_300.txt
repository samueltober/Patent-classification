 JPA       The springs used in conjunction with the vehicle specifically leaf springs  preferably parabolic springs are steel specifically having a central region  and two adjacent edge regions a b It has a single spring plate  made of spring steel each of the edge regions a b has end regions a b and end regions a b Each of the b can be statically connected to the chassis via a rotary mesh  and the total length of the spring when installed on the vehicle is substantially under all load conditions It is immutable In the noload state the spring plate  has two bending sections  each of which has a curve in the bending direction and the two bending sections  have opposite bending directions The two flexion compartments  merge with each other within the region of the bifurcation point  The first bending section  is a vertical spring section which extends from the end region a of the first edge region a to the bifurcation point  via the central region  The second flexion section  is a horizontal and vertical spring section that extends from the bifurcation point  to the end region b of the second edge region b
