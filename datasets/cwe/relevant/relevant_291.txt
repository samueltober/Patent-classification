 CNU The utility model relates to a shielding type hub bearing sensor end cover The cover comprises a cover body of an integrated structure The cover body is provided with a disc part and a cylinder part the outer peripheral surface of the axial middle part of the cylindrical part is provided with a flange part which is formed in a manner of protruding outwards in the radial direction Wherein a sensor mounting hole and a threaded hole are formed in the disc part a drain hole is formed in the peripheral surface of the cylinder part a baffle plate is arranged at the drain hole one end of the baffle plate is fixedly connected with the edge of the drain hole and the other end of the baffle plate extends out of the disc part and forms an opening with the drain hole According to the hub bearing sensor end cover with the shielding function a nonshielding type drainage hole is changed into the shielding type drainage hole impurities such as largeparticle sand can be prevented from splashing into the end cover meanwhile discharging of muddy water in the end cover is not affected and the problems that the surface of a magnetic ring is damaged and a product is scrapped due to the fact that largeparticle silt cannot be discharged are solved
