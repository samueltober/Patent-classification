 KRA Disclosed in the present invention are an active suspension device for a vehicle and a block thereof In particular provided according to one aspect of the present invention is an active suspension device for a vehicle which comprises a cylinder divided into a compression chamber and a tension chamber by a piston valve a connecting line including a first flow path communicating with the compression chamber and having a first variable valve generating damping force a second flow path communicating with the tension chamber and having a second variable valve generating damping force a third flow path at which the first flow path and the second flow path are joined a fourth flow path branched from the third flow path to communicate with the compression chamber and a fifth flow path branched from the third flow path to communicate with the tension chamber a bidirectional pump connected to the fourth flow path and the fifth flow path to selectively supply fluid to the compression chamber and the tension chamber and an accumulator connected to the third flow path to compensate the difference in volume between the compression chamber and the tension chamber The fourth flow path and the fifth flow path individually have at least one check valve allowing only the flow of fluid heading from the third flow path to the compression chamber or the tension chamber Therefore space utilization can be improved and fabrication costs can be reduced
