 DEA     The invention relates to a motor vehicle  with a chassis  a front axle  a first rear axle  carried by first axle carriers  and a second rear axle  carried by second axle carriers  The two rear axles   are provided for different payloads T TIn vehicles with different rear axles however it is not easy to equip them with additional hydropneumatic suspension to increase driving comfort or with additional air suspension The weight load acting on the different axles leads to different pressures in the cylinders or the air suspension bellows and thus to different levels of wear and  or deteriorated driving comfortIn order to improve driving comfort and provide rear axles with optimized payloads it is proposed that the bearings    of the first rear axle  and the bearings    of the second rear axle  on the axle carriers   are arranged so that the loads resulting from the loads T T cause corresponding loads in the spring elements  This makes it possible to supplement the factoryprovided first rear axle with an additional second rear axle in such a way that on the one hand a desired permissible total weight for example  to is achieved and on the other hand when an additional suspension is attached the same forces in the spring elements of the additional Suspension can be initiated
