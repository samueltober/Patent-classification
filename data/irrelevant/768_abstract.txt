The embodiment of the invention discloses an ACDC conversion circuit and the ACDC conversion circuit comprises a rectification circuit which converts a received input AC voltage into an input DC voltage for output a first DCDC conversion module which comprises a plurality of power switches and inductors is coupled between the rectification circuit and a second DCDC conversion module and enables the waveform of the input current of the first DCDC conversion module to follow the input DC voltage by controlling the working state of the power switches so as to realize power factor correction wherein the path for receiving the input DC voltage at least comprises two power switches in a conducting state so that the voltage borne by each power switch in the first DCDC conversion module is reduced and a second DCDC conversion module the output end of which is coupled with a load so as to drive the load The ACDC conversion circuit is small in size smaller in switching loss smaller in energy loss better in heat dissipation and larger in power density of the whole circuit
