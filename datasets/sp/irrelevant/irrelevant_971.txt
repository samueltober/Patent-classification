 CNU The utility model discloses a shock absorber for automobile suspension The shock absorber comprises a damping spring a pressure mechanism a bearing mechanism a sliding rod a chassis a detectionmechanism a sliding sleeve a fixing screw detection paper a mounting opening and a driving mechanism The beneficial effects of the utility model are that the fixing screw is in threaded connection with the side wall of the sliding sleeve to fix the detection paper and the detection paper is attached to the side wall of the sliding rod then the whole structure is installed on a vehicle bodythrough a fixing plate when the overall structure is detected a straight line penetrates through the detection hole in the surface of the transition disc The limiting ring extends into the guide groove in the side wall of the limiting ring further the straight screwdriver is propped against the inner part of the bottom hole in the bottom of the sliding sleeve the linear driver is pushed tojack up the sliding sleeve friction between the detection paper and the side wall of the sliding rod is achieved the linear driver reset spring is loosened to reset the sliding sleeve whether hydraulic oil is adsorbed to the detection paper or not is further observed if hydraulic oil exists the whole shock absorber needs to be replaced observation is convenient maintenance time is shortened and safe driving is facilitated
