The invention provides a hybrid braking method for a highvoltage highpower electromagnetic synchronous motor A braking circuit breaker is kept in an off state during rapid deceleration a frequency converter decelerates to a target rotating speed at a constant acceleration and energy in the deceleration process is consumed on a braking resistor on the directcurrent side of the frequency converter during emergency stop if the rotating speed of the motor is higher than  of the highest rotating speed the frequency converter blocks the driving pulse of a power device and freely decelerates completely by means of load torque if the current rotating speed of the motor is within the rotating speed interval of  of the highest rotating speed a braking method for reducing the speed by adopting a motor stator side resistance energy consumption braking mode besides a load torque braking effect is adopted and if the current motor rotating speed is lower than  of the highestrotating speed and the brake circuit breaker is disconnected the frequency converter recovers the power device driving pulse The requirement for frequent deceleration or parking and the requirementfor emergency parking in conventional time can be met and the complexity degree of structural design and control when existing energy consumption braking is applied to the cascaded highvoltage frequency converter can be reduced
