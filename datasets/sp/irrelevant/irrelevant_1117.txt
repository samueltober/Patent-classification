 CNU The utility model discloses an automobile stabilizing device The driving device comprises at least one set of rotating bodies and a driving assembly used for driving the rotating bodies to rotate the rotating bodies are horizontally arranged on an automobile body of the automobile rotating shafts of the rotating bodies are arranged in the width direction of the automobile body and when the automobile is in the running process the rotating bodies are in the rotating state under the action of the driving assembly According to the utility model the rotator is arranged on the vehicle bodyvehicle body driving process the driving assembly drives the rotating body to rotate at high speed the rotating body abides by angular momentum conservation in the rotating process when one wheel on the vehicle body passes through a pit or a protrusion the wheel rotates When the vehicle body rotates at a high speed the vehicle body has an upward or downward deflection trend when the vehiclebody deflects the rotating body is driven to deflect at the same time based on the law of conservation of angular momentum the rotating body rotating at a high speed can restrain the deflection trend the vehicle body is kept in a stable state and acting force generated by vibration acts on a suspension and is buffered through the suspension
