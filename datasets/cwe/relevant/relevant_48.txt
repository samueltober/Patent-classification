 CNB The invention relates to a roller bearing assembly particularly a wheel bearing assembly having a slinger ring  a sealing ring and a series of roller bearings the rolling elements  thereof being provided for load transfer between the inner  and outer ring  and lie in a rolling element cage  wherein the rolling element cage  in conjunction with the rolling elements  axially fixes the inner ring  with a degree of play The aim is to prevent undesired folding down of a radial sealing lip of the sealing ring and a normally unnoticed slipping thereof from the contact surface of the slinger ring  in the assembled state of the roller bearing According to the invention a rolling element cage  andor a sealing ring is used that limits the axial play of the inner ring  in the assembled state of the bearing assembly to such an extent that the radial sealing lip remains on the cylindrical part of the slinger ring  independently of the axial position of the inner ring
