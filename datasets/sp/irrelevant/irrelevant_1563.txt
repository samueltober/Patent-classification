 CNU The utility model provides an automatic control system for a trailer lifting axle which comprises a height sensor a controller and a controller wherein the height sensor collects the height of an air bag of a trailer in the vertical direction to obtain vehicle body height information the trailer electronic braking system continuously collects trailer loads obtains trailer load data processesthe trailer load data and then sends a control instruction the air suspension solenoid valve is connected with an air source and is connected with the height sensor and the trailer electronic braking system and the air suspension solenoid valve receives a control instruction sent by the trailer electronic braking system and controls inflation or deflation of an air bag of the trailer so that alifting bridge of the trailer ascends or descends The control method can automatically control the lifting bridge of the trailer to ascend and descend according to the realtime load data of the airspring of the trailer so that the mode of manually controlling the lifting bridge of the trailer to ascend or descend is replaced automatic lifting of the lifting bridge is achieved and the lifting bridge control process is more intelligent and therefore the oil consumption is reduced and the loss of trailer tires in a nonfullload state is reduced
