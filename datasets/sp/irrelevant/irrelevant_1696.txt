 CNA The invention provides a load selfadaptive suspension rigidity design method and a suspension elastic assembly The suspension elastic assembly comprises a main spring a buffer block and a limiting block When a vehicle does not carry goods the main spring is independently compressed and the rigidity of the vehicle suspension is basically constant when the vehicle bears goods the buffer block makes contact with a chassis to be compressed and the rigidity of the suspension is increased along with increase of the load capacity when the vehicle encounters impact the limiting block makes contact with the chassis and is compressed so as to resist the impact force The design method comprises the steps of designing a vehicle suspension stiffness curve meeting requirements according to vehicle bearing requirements designing the arrangement position of the elastic assembly and determining the contact opportunity of the buffer block and the limiting block and determining monomer rigidity curves of the main spring the buffer block and the limiting block The rigidity of the vehicle suspension provided by the invention can be adaptively changed along with the change of the vehicle load so that the riding comfort of passengers is facilitated and the impact damage to the vehicle body is reduced
