 JPA To provide a bearing unit capable of effectively preventing the entry of foreign matters such as water and mud into a bearing when eliminating an Oring from a region where the inner side end of a stationary ring and a cover member abut on each other and of dissolving inconveniences such as restriction on a suitable material due to the use of the Oring while greatly reducing the costSOLUTION The bearing unit includes a cover member  fitted to an inner side end  of an outer ring  to seal At the inner side end  a step part  is formed An axial face part  of the cover member  is made to abut on an axial face part  located on the inner side further than the step part  to form an abutment region  On the outer diameter side of the abutment region  a radial face part  of the cover member  is located so as to overlap with the outer diameter side of a radial face part of the step part  in the radial direction The radial face part of the step part  is formed recessed to the radial inside and the inner diameter face of the radial face part of the cover member  is formed as a tapered face whose diameter is gradually larger toward the outer sideSELECTED DRAWING Figure
