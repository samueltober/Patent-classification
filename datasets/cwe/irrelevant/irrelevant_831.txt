 CNU     The utility model discloses a wheel hub capable of fast disassembly and assembly of a nut The wheel hub includes a hub body and a fixing mechanism The fixing mechanism is arranged inside one side of the hub body The tightening and fitting part is a movable rotary connection which minimizes the friction between the nut and the hub body during disassembly which facilitates quick disassembly and assembly of the nut When disassembly and assembly of the nut the compression of the spring is adopted  So that the nut provides outward force when disassembling and further accelerates the disassembly speed of the nut The elastic block forms a rolling connection with the inner wall of the shell through the cooperation of the small steel ball and the rolling groove so as to avoid the internal elastic block when the nut is installed The spring tilts and directly rubs against the inner wall of the housing causing the nut to fail to install or the installation speed is slow ensuring smooth operation of internal parts when the nut is installed and speeding up the efficiency of nut disassembly
