 CNA The invention discloses a rebounding correction method and a structure of a heavyload suspension steering tire which belong to the technical field of steering tire rebounding correction systems A pressure value is detected by a pressure sensor arranged in the suspension oil cylinder the pressure sensor detects a pressure value and sends the pressure value to the vehiclemounted computer control system to calculate a suspended load the load is taken as an input variable the system calculates the lag angle of suspension steering then the steering mechanism is controlled to push the suspension to steer by one more lag angle than the steering information input by the steering wheel and then the steering mechanism is decompressed and suspended to rotate to a control corner input by thesteering wheel under the action of rebounding moment of the rubber tire so that huge impact load generated when the original steering mechanism rotates reversely can be solved the steering mechanism is protected and the service life of the system is prolonged
