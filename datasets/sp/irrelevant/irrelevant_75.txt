 CNB     A system for controlling a motor vehicle with a torsion beam type axle is provided The torsion beam type axle has a cross beam and two longitudinal arms connected to the cross beam Each of the two longitudinal arms is in the longitudinal direction of the motor vehicle A wheel suspension mounting device for fixing a wheel of a motor vehicle is provided in the direction at its rear end and each of the two trailing arms is connected to the motor vehicle body through a bearing at its front end Each bearing is connected to a MEMS designed as an actuator The use of this MEMS can cause the movement of the bearing and therefore the movement of the torsion beam axle around the vertical motor vehicle axis or can counteract the undesirable effects of the torsion beam axle exercise
