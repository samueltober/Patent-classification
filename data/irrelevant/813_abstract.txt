The invention relates to the technical field of power system operation control and discloses a power transmission network voltage doublelayer control method based on active and reactive power coordinated optimization The method comprises the following steps constructing an active and reactive power coupling model of schedulable resources of a power transmission network constructing an alternating current power flow equation of a line net rack and converting a nonconvex power flow constraint equation into a solvable secondorder cone optimization problem through a secondorder cone relaxation method combining the output limit of the constructed active and reactive coupling model with the line alternating current power flow limit obtained by relaxation and solving a mixed integer secondorder cone optimization problem of a multiobjective function by taking the voltage deviation minimization of each node and the scheduling cost minimization as the objective function to obtain the output value of each device and constructing a doublelayer voltage control model to control the voltage of the power transmission network Compared with the prior art by using the method of the invention the secondorder cone relaxation method of the alternating current power flow is expanded to the voltage control of the power transmission network and dayahead lookahead scheduling and intraday rolling optimization are combined so that a more accurate scheduling result is obtained
