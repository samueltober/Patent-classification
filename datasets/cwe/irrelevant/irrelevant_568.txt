 JPA To provide a saddleriding type vehicle which can change a state between a state in which a driven wheel is driven by the power from an engine and a state in which the driven wheel is driven by the power from an electric motor and which can efficiently transmit the power from the electric motor to the driven wheel without an interference of the electric motor with other componentsSOLUTION A hub  includes a cylindrical portion  and a wall portion  The cylindrical portion has an axle inserted therein and is placed coaxially with the axle The electric motor includes an outer rotor  and a stator  The outer rotor is placed coaxially with the axle with the axle being inserted therein The outer rotor is rotatable together with the cylindrical portion since at least a part is connected to the cylindrical portion with such a portion being retained therein The stator is coaxially placed with the axle with the axle being inserted therein The stator is coaxially placed with the outer rotor with the stator being inserted therein The stator is fastened to the axleSELECTED DRAWING Figure
