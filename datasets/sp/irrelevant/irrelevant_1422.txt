 CNA The invention relates to a steering axle assembly with a side impact energy absorption structure The assembly comprises a frame a steering axle a vertically telescopic automobile shock absorber andtwo side bumpers distributed at the two sides of the frame along the length direction of the steering axle and the two ends of the steering axle respectively support the frame through the automobileshock absorber and the frame is provided with a steering axle part cross beam positioned above the steering axle and the side bumpers are connected with the steering axle part cross beam through asteering axle part side collision energy absorption mechanism According to the steering axle assembly with the side impact energy absorption structure side impact energy can be absorbed without crumpling deformation of the frame during side impact and the shock absorber supporting the frame also participates in side impact energy absorption so that the problems of poor safety and single function of the shock absorber due to the fact that an automobile body needs to crumple to absorb energy during side impact of an existing automobile are solved
