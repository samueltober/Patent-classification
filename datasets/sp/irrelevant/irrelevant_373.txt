 CNA The invention relates to a singleshell spring control arm  formed of sheet metal for a wheel suspension of a motor vehicle with upwardly directed side limbs  connected to one another by a base with a first end section  for connection to a chassis girder with a second end section  for wheelside connection with a spring receiving section  which is located between the two end sections and has a spring support surface  formed on the base and with a damper receiving section  formed between the spring receiving section  and the second end section  for connecting a shock absorber In order to achieve at relatively low component weight and favorable manufacturing costs improved stiffness with respect to high axle loads the invention provides that a Ushaped constriction  is formed between the spring support surface and the damper receiving section which constriction extends in the base  and in the side limbs
