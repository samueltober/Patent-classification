 CNA     The application relates to a method system and device for regenerative braking energy distribution of a locomotive The method includes receiving the traction substation measurement data output by each RPC the traction substation measurement data includes the first power supply arm current information the second power supply arm current information and the contact network voltage information based on the traction substation measurement data each first power supply is obtained The train power of each arm and the train power of each second power supply arm the ant colony optimization model is used to process the train power of each first power supply arm and the train power of each second power supply arm and the optimal solution is output the optimal solution is used to instruct each ETC to perform regeneration system Dynamic power regulation to achieve the maximum utilization of regenerative braking energy By adopting the method the effective utilization of the regenerative braking energy of the locomotive can be realized the operation risk of the power supply network can be reduced and the operation safety of the locomotive can be improved
