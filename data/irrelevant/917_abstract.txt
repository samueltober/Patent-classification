The invention discloses a flood control dispatching method based on a digital twin which includes the following steps S building a digital twin of a flood control dispatching system S tracking and updating the digital twin of a flood control dispatching system to obtain realtime synchronized flood control dispatching System digital twin S based on realtime synchronized flood control dispatching system digital twin which uses meteorological models and multiple hydrological models to carry out meteorological and hydrological ensemble forecasts predicts the flood control dispatch process of the target reservoir in the next week and conducts flood control situation according to the forecast results Analyze and judge and propose an adjustment plan for the current dispatching rules of the reservoir The advantages are overcome the shortcomings of the existing flood control dispatching methods that cannot fully reflect the realtime information of flood control dispatching the short effective forecast period of meteorological and hydrological forecasts and the low forecast accuracy can accurately provide flood control dispatching process information dynamically assess flood control risks so as to smoothly carry out floods Disaster prevention work
