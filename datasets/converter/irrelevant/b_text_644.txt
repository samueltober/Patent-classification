 CNB The invention discloses a nuclear magnetic resonance pulse sequence controller All nuclear magnetic resonance pulse sequence controller subsystems are electrically connected in sequence all nuclearmagnetic resonance pulse sequence controller subsystems have the same reference clock and the nuclear magnetic resonance pulse sequence controller subsystems are arranged in a plugin box the systemcomprises a plurality of integrated receiving and transmitting machines a multibus computer a power supply and a backboard The power supply is electrically connected with the integrated transceiver and the multibus computer through the backboard and each of the power supply the multibus computer and all the integrated transceivers is inserted into each backboard slot of the backboard According to the invention the technical problems that a miniaturized nuclear magnetic resonance instrument can only be used as an instrument with a specific function due to fixed channel number and function and low working frequency range so that the working requirements of flexible and complex functions expandable channel number and wide frequency range of a nuclear magnetic resonance imager orspectrometer cannot be met can be solved
