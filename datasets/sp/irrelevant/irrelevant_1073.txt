 CNU The utility model relates to a shock absorption assembly The shock absorption assembly comprises a first seat body a second seat body a first elastic element a second elastic element and a rod body The first elastic element is arranged between the first seat body and the second seat body a containing cavity is formed in the first seat body the second elastic element is arranged in the containing cavity the rod body is fixedly connected to the second seat body and extends into the containing cavity and the rod body and the second elastic element are oppositely arranged A handling apparatus is also provided Compared with the prior art when the shock absorption assembly is shocked pressure applied between the first seat body and the second seat body is transmitted to the second elastic element through the first elastic element on one hand the load borne by the first elastic element is reduced and on the other hand the shock absorption assembly can provide two rigidities which are used for bearing light loads and heavy loads respectively The shock absorption assembly is good in shock absorption performance the pressure of wheels on the ground is increased through thebounce of the shock absorption assembly the friction force of the wheels is increased and slipping and derailing are prevented
