 CNB The invention provides a subcarrier resource allocation method based on an energy efficiency game An energy efficiency game strategy is adopted to optimize a subcarrier allocation problem Aiming atthe characteristic that an FBMC modulation technology does not require mutual orthogonality of subcarriers and competition between subcarriers exists a channel state matrix that displays current subcarrier quality is introduced total power consumption of a system power consumption on single subcarriers total time delay an interference temperature limit and secondary user number on single subcarriers are taken as constraint conditions energy efficiency is used as an objective function and a fractional programming problem under multiple constraint conditions is established A game operator is designed a utility function is established for each secondary user and when the utility function of each secondary user is optimal and an evolution game reaches a Nash equilibrium point a strategy combination at this moment is considered to be a resource allocation method with optimal energy efficiency Compared with some existing methods the energy efficiency of the method EESAEG provided by the invention is optimal the most reasonable subcarrier allocation scheme is given and more subcarriers are allocated to a channel in a better state
