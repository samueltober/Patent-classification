An energy selfpickup wireless sensor network comprises a sink node a sensing node and a relay node Take advantage of the sink node and the relay node a relatively uniform magnetic field is constructed in a small enclosed space so that wireless energy can be realized between the sink node and the sensor node by using a magnetic coupling resonance mode information is transmitted simultaneouslyon mutually independent transmission channels and a single sink node can supply energy for multiple sensor nodes and simultaneously communicate with multiple sensor nodes in a bidirectional mannerThe energy selfpickup wireless sensor network is realized based on time division multiple access technology and breaks through the scheme that the traditional wireless sensor adopts battery energystorage and power supply and utilizes microwave wireless to realize information transmission at the same time and utilizes multiresonant coupling mode to realize energy and simultaneous transmissionof information on mutually independent transmission channels
