 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of driving in particular to a driving device and an AGV automatic guided vehicle chassis The driving device comprises a mounting plate two damping mechanisms and two driving wheels the two driving wheels are arranged at the bottom of the mounting plate in parallel each driving wheel is provided with one damping mechanism each damping mechanism comprises a supporting rod an offset plate and an elastic component the first ends of the supporting rods are rigidly connected to the mounting plate the second ends of the supporting rods are hinged to the first ends of the offset plates the first ends of the elastic components are hinged to the mounting plate the second ends of the elastic components are hinged to the second ends of the offset plates and each driving wheel is hinged to the corresponding offset plate through a first rotating shaft According to the driving device and the AGV automatic guided vehicle chassis the technical problem that in the prior art each wheel cannot independently absorb shock when a single wheel encounters an obstacle can be effectively solved so that the motion stability of the driving deviceis improved and the adverse condition that one wheel encounters the obstacle and jounces to influence another wheel can be avoided
