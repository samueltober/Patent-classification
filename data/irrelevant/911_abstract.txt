This application relates to the field of highvoltage power transmission and in particular to a control method of a hybrid cascaded direct current transmission system The hybrid cascaded direct current transmission system includes a rectifier station and an inverter station The inverter station includes a plurality of voltage source types connected in parallel In a converter the method includes obtaining the effective value of the voltage on the AC side of the voltage source converter judging whether the voltage source converter has a fault based on the voltage effective value If the converter fails at least one of the voltage source converters that work normally is controlled to perform power compensation
