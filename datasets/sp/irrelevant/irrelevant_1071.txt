 CNU The utility model discloses a hydropneumatic suspension hydraulic system The device comprises a fixing frame two clamping grooves are formed in the top end of the fixing frame six threaded motorsare fixedly connected to the top end of the fixing frame Threaded columns are fixedly connected to the output ends of the six threaded motors four hydraulic cylinders are rotatably connected to thetop end of the fixing frame piston columns are connected into the four hydraulic cylinders in an embedded and sliding mode angular displacement sensors are fixedly connected to the outer surfaces ofthe four hydraulic cylinders and air springs are connected to the sides away from the four hydraulic cylinders of the four piston columns in an embedded and sliding mode According to the utilitymodel the structure is simple the first helical gear the third helical gear and the fourth helical gear rotate so that the second helical gear on the fixing frame drives the hydraulic cylinder torotate and through realtime monitoring of the angular displacement sensor the controller can conveniently control the rotating angle of the hydraulic cylinder so that the whole vehicle body is lifted and meanwhile the arrangement of a driving motor is reduced to reduce the cost of the device
