The invention provides a control method of a multilevel converter wherein the multilevel converter comprises n cascaded power modules and a control module coupled with the n power modules The method comprises the following steps grouping power modules which start to work need to update an output state or stop working according to the working state of a multilevel converter to form m power module groups wherein n is greater than or equal to m and greater than or equal to  and controlling the power modules of the same power module group to simultaneously start to work simultaneously updating the output state or simultaneously stopping working and sequentially controlling the m power module groups to start to work update the output state or stop working according to a preset timeinterval wherein the number of the power modules of each power module group is less than or equal to a preset value so that the output level jump of each power module group is less than or equal toa preset voltage value According to the embodiment of the invention the jump amplitude of the commonmode voltage is controlled by controlling the jump of the output level of each power module andthe commonmode interference can be reduced
