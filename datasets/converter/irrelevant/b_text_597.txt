 CNB The invention discloses an energy control method of a multiport alternatingcurrent and directcurrent hybrid microgrid system According to an alternatingcurrent loop in the model capacitor voltages in the modular multilevel converter the dualactive fullbridge converter and the submodules and output currents on the alternatingcurrent side are controlled through total energy control and alternatingcurrent output current control according to a directcurrent loop in the model the sum of the capacitor voltages of the upper bridge arm and the lower bridge arm of each phase is controlled through interphase energy control and a directcurrent component of circulation reference is obtained the difference between the capacitor voltages of the submodules between the upper bridge armand the lower bridge arm in the same phase is balanced through interarm energy control and a fundamental frequency alternating current component of circulation reference is obtained direct currentand fundamental frequency alternating current components in the modular multilevel converter are tracked through a circulation controller inherent frequency doubling current is suppressed and capacitance energy in a bridge arm is adjusted through phaseshifting carrier modulation modulation signals of the submodules are adjusted and capacitance and voltage balance of the submodules is achieved
