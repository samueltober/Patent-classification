 CNA The invention discloses a parallel selfadaptive nonindependent suspension Mecanum wheel chassis system and relates to the technical field of robot chassis in particular to a parallel selfadaptive nonindependent suspension Mecanum wheel chassis system for bearing robot walking The chassis comprises a chassis frame and a nonindependent suspension wheel set the chassis frame is of a shaped frame structure composed of two cross beams and two longitudinal beams The nonindependent suspension wheel set is composed of two independent suspensions of the same structure two front wheels and two rear wheels Two groups of independent suspensions are symmetrically arranged at the upper parts of two ends of the chassis frame and the two front wheels and the two rear wheels are respectively arranged at the front parts and the rear parts of the two groups of independent suspensions According to the parallel selfadaptive nonindependent suspension Mecanum wheel chassis system the problems that in the prior art the singlewheel stepmissing preset action time efficiency is poor the singlewheel obstacle passing stability is poor a suspension system cannot play a role when going down a step energy absorption is limited and the requirement for the strength of a spring in a connecting rod is high are solved
