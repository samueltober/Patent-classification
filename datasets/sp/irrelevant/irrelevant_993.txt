 CNA The invention discloses a fourwheel linkage connecting rod structure The fourwheel linkage connecting rod structure comprises rocker arm pull rods transverse stabilizing rods and frontback connecting rods one ends of the rocker arm pull rods are connected with shock absorber rocker arms through rod end bearings the other ends of the rocker arm pull rods are connected with transverse stabilizing rod rocker arms the transverse stabilizing rod rocker arms are installed at the two ends of the transverse stabilizing rod below a chassis and the two ends of the frontback connecting rods are rotationally connected with lugs with holes welded to the middles of the front transverse stabilizing rod and the rear transverse stabilizing rod through rod end bearings respectively The connecting rod structure is designed through the unidirectionality of force and four wheels of a racing car can be combined so when one wheel is stressed or hindered the force is transmitted to the otherthree wheels the shock absorbers and the springs of the four wheels are used for absorbing the force thereby the purposes of preventing side tilting and stabilizing a car body are achieved
