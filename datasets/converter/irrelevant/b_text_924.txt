 CNA     The invention discloses a highvoltage frequency converter power unit cabinet with a selfcirculating cold air device A selfincreasing heat removal mechanism is connected and a multilevel heat dissipation mechanism is connected to the selfincreasing heat removal mechanism The present invention can realize the followup heat dissipation adjustment action of a single area through the selfincreasing heat removal mechanism to avoid the heat dissipation efficiency of a single area When a reduction occurs during the actual implementation the selfincreasing heat removal mechanism will guide the cold air to blow the single highvoltage inverter from top to bottom and guide the blowing wind to the multistage heat dissipation mechanism and convert the hot air of the inner box through the multistage heat dissipation mechanism For cold air a singlezone circulation action is implemented In the process of implementing a singlezone circulation action the selfincreasing heat removal mechanism can increase the blowing intensity of the cold air according to the heat of the blowing wind to perform a singlezone followup heat dissipation adjustment action
