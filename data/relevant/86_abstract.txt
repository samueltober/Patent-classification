The present invention provides a dynamic cascading predictive control method based on current error threshold which realizes multiobject control by prioritizing different control targets according to their importance and then filtering switch vectors in the order of priority eliminating The traditional model has many control power coefficients complicated debugging mixed multiobjective problems and confused priorities This method automatically adjusts the number of switching vectors selected by the firstlevel current controller through current error calculation and overcomes the problem of poor control performance for lower priority targets caused by the fixed selection of switching vectors in the traditional cascade predictive control In addition this method also improves the effect of the firststage current control and improves the power quality of the permanent magnet synchronous wind turbine gridconnected This method has broad application prospects in the field of wind power grid connection
