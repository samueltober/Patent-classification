 USB A multilevel buck converter includes an input power source an input capacitor first to fourth switches a clamp capacitor an output inductor a clamp switch a clamp diode an output capacitor an output load a current detection circuit a voltage detection circuit and a control circuit The current detection circuit detects whether an inductor current of the output inductor exceeds a predetermined current value and if so the output clamp signal controls the clamp switch to be turned on The voltage detection circuit generates a duty cycle control signal according to an error between an output voltage and a target output voltage The control circuit controls the first to the fourth switches to sequentially enter a first mode a second mode a third mode and a fourth mode in a first part of a duty cycle
