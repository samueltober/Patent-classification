 KRB     The present invention proposes a vehicle attitude control device and method for generating a torsional force using a rotary actuator in the middle of a stabilizer bar to compensate for left and right deflection through the stabilizer bar The proposed apparatus includes an actuator for connecting a first stabilizer bar connected to one wheel of a vehicle and a second stabilizer bar connected to the other wheel of the vehicle and controlling the attitude of the vehicle A first electronic control device that detects a roll angle of the vehicle based on sensing information obtained from sensors mounted on the vehicle during driving And a second electronic control device for calculating a torque for compensating the roll angle of the vehicle and controlling the actuator based on the torque
