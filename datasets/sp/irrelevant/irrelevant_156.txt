 CNB The invention provides a stabilizer bar system for a Formula SAE race car The stabilizer bar system comprises bar end bearings  M nuts  tie bars  adjusting arms  bolts  clampingsleeves   upper fixing lugs  a torsion bar  and shaft circlips  The stabilizer bar system adds detachable copper sleeves between the torsion bar and the fixing lugs of a stabilizer barto reduce the friction resistance of the stabilizer bar system and realizes the necessary replacement according to the wear condition of the copper sleeves so as to ensure the consistency of actual parameters with design parameters of the stabilizer bar system as much as possible and at the same time by optimizing the structure of the upper fixing lugs  and decreasing the cantilever length of the torsion bar  the stabilizer bar system reduces the influence on the roll stiffness provided by the stabilizer bar system due to the bending deformation of the torsion bar
