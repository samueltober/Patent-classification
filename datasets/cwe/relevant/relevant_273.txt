 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device which can accurately position a shaft part in an accommodation hole even if forming the accommodation hole whose bottom part is blocked to a support member for supporting a magnetic field sensor which is formed by sealing a magnetic field detection element by the sealing member and accommodating the shaft part of the sealing member for holding the magnetic field detection element in the accommodation holeSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  comprises an inner member  attached with a wheel an outer member  for supporting the inner member  via a plurality of rolling bodies  an encoder  fixed to the inner member  and having a magnetic member  having a plurality of magnetic poles in a peripheral direction a magnetic field sensor  which is formed by sealing a magnetic field detection sensor  by a columnar shaft part  and a cover  having an accommodation hole  for accommodating the shaft part  and supporting the magnetic field sensor  to the outer member  The cover  has first to third protrusions  to  which protrude inward from an internal peripheral face b of the accommodation hole  abut on an external peripheral face a of the shaft part  and position the shaft part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
