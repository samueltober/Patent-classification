A dual submodule is created for a modular multilevel converter whereby the dual submodule has two interconnected submodules whereby each submodule has an asymmetrical halfbridge circuit with two parallel bridge branches which are connected between a first and a second terminal connection of the submodule whereby each bridge branch is formed from a series circuit of a power semiconductor switch and a diode whereby the power semiconductor switch is allocated to an antiparallel freewheeling diode and has a capacitor which is connected in parallel with the asymmetrical halfbridge circuit between the first and the second terminal connections of the module The submodules are connected to each other via their AC terminals to form the dual submodule Further a modular multilevel converter is created comprising a number of such dual submodules in each of its converter branches
