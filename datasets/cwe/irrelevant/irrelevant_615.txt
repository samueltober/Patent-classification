 CNA The invention discloses a widebody heavyduty vehicle shortshaft axle based on distributed electric drive and a vehicle the axle comprises an axle tube and electric wheel mechanisms the electric wheel mechanisms are arranged at the two ends of the axle tube in a bilateral symmetry mode and the electric wheel mechanism at each end comprises a motor a planetary gear speed reducing mechanism arim and a shell a power output shaft of the motor is in rigid connection with the power input end of the planetary gear speed reduction mechanism a gear ring of the planetary gear speed reduction mechanism is fixedly connected with the shell and the power output end of the planetary gear speed reduction mechanism is in rigid connection with the rim and power of the motor drives the rim afterbeing decelerated by the planetary gear system so as to drive the wheel to move forwards Electric drive planetary gear transmission is used for replacing hydraulic transmission the mechanical transmission efficiency is higher the requirement for the machining precision of elements is relatively low the cost is reduced there is no hydraulic leakage risk the maintenancefree capacity is highthe safety is higher and the wheel is suitable for commercial vehicle wheels with double tires installed in parallel
