The invention discloses a doubleended multilevel inverter circuit and an inverter system The doubleended multilevel inverter circuit comprises a first switched capacitor unit a second switched capacitor unit a first halfbridge circuit and a second halfbridge circuit The first halfbridge circuit comprises a first full control switch and a second full control switch The second halfbridge circuit includes a third full control switch and a fourth full control switch The controller is configured to instruct the first switched capacitor unit and the second switched capacitor unit to convert the DC power output by a DC voltage source into multilevel DC power and convert the multilevel DC power into multilevel AC to be output by controlling the onoff states of the full control switches in the first halfbridge circuit and the second halfbridge circuit It can be seen that the multilevel inverter circuit includes a small number of switches is not only simple in structure and low in cost but also low in conduction loss and high in efficiency thereby facilitating the development of new energy technologies In addition the doubleended multilevel inverter circuit usesonly one DC voltage source and is lower in cost than the multilevel inverter circuit of a conventional multiinput power supply
