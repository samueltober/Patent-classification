A method for regulating an AC output current of a converter having a DC voltage intermediate circuit and a semiconductor switch in a bridge circuit for converting a DC voltage of the DC voltage intermediate circuit into an AC output current The AC output current is regulated by way of a direct hysteresis current regulation in which an actual value of the AC output current is maintained within a hysteresis window around a set point value Furthermore a hysteresis width of the hysteresis window is modulated in order to adjust a frequency spectrum of the AC output current
