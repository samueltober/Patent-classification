 WOA A synchronous switching scheme with adaptive slew control in order to adiabatically charge and discharge a capacitor to recycle charge and generate a boosted voltage on the gate of the synchronous rectifier field effect transistor FET is described In one embodiment an apparatus includes a synchronous rectifier FET coupled to a transformer and a secondaryside controller coupled to the synchronous rectifier FET The secondaryside controller includes a synchronous rectifier gate driver SRGD coupled to a gate of the synchronous rectifier FET The SRGD is to drive the synchronous rectifier FET using the capacitor and an adaptive slew rate and to adiabatically charge and discharge the capacitor
