To realize excellent system efficiency by maintaining the temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell on the subsequent stage side properly even when multiple solid oxide fuel cells are cascaded thereby restraining deterioration of power generation performanceSOLUTION A fuel cell power generation system  includes a first fuel cell  a second fuel cell  for generating power by using second fuel gas Gf on a second fuel gas supply line  discharged from the first fuel cell an inverter  for converting DC power generated by the second fuel cell into AC power and an adjustment valve  capable of adjusting supply amount of second oxidizer gas Go on a second oxidizer gas supply line  for the second fuel cell At least one of the setting current amount of the second fuel cell or the opening of the adjustment valve is adjusted so that the temperature of the second fuel cell becomes a reference valueSELECTED DRAWING Figure
