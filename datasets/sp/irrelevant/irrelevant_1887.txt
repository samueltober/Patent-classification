 CNU     The utility model discloses an asynchronous selfstabilizing wheel type differential motion system which is used for highefficiency maneuvering in the natural terrain of the surface of an extraterrestrial body The utility model includes a bearing body and wheels symmetrically arranged on the left and right sides of the bearing body Type driving mechanism the wheel type driving mechanism includes a Ushaped suspension the middle part of the Ushaped suspension is rotatably connected to the side of the loadbearing fuselage through a bearing wheels are fixedly connected to the Ushaped suspension Two spring assemblies arranged symmetrically the upper end of the two spring assemblies are hinged with the side of the forcebearing fuselage and the lower end is hinged with the Ushaped suspension which is used for the Ushaped suspension Provide elastic support during suspension The utility model adopts the suspension scheme of asynchronous and passive adaptation to the terrain on the left and right sides realizes steering through the differential speed between wheels and has the advantages of simple and reliable system and convenient control while ensuring the adaptability of natural terrain on the surface of celestial bodies such as the moon
