The invention discloses a reliability evaluation method for a vehiclemounted composite power supply based on a Markov chain and a Bayesian network Firstly based on the Markov chain theory established are state transition diagrams when four different topological structural composite power supplies of a cascaded structural composite power supply with a supercapacitor located at an intermediate position a cascaded structural composite power supply with a storage battery at the intermediate position a parallel structural composite power supply and a multiinput power converter structural composite power supply break down secondly according to the state transition diagrams when the four different topological structural composite power systems break down a Bayesian network model diagram which eventually causes failure of the composite power supply resulting in the system in a paralyzed state is established based on the Bayesian network theory finally according to the established Bayesian network model diagram the failure rates of the four different topological structural composite power supplies are obtained by calculation comparative analysis is carried out and reliability evaluation is further carried out to obtain the composite power supply with the strongest reliability thereby avoiding trial and error in engineering practice
