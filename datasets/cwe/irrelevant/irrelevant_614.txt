 CNU The maintenancefree hub unit for the drive axle comprises a hub and an axle the axle is rotationally supported through a bearing mechanism a circle of protruding ring is arranged on the inner sidewall of the hub the bearing mechanism comprises two conical roller bearings arranged at an interval the outer rings of the two conical roller bearings abut against the two sides of the protruding ring respectively and the outer rings of the two conical roller bearings abut against the two sides of the protruding ring respectively The inner rings of the two tapered roller bearings abut againsteach other the sides abutting against each other of the two inner rings are each provided with a limiting groove a Cshaped hoop is buckled into the two limiting grooves then the inner rings of the two tapered roller bearings are fixedly connected into a whole and the abutting positions of the inner rings of the two tapered roller bearings are sleeved with a circle of installation ring Twosealing ring seats are arranged on the mounting ring at intervals and sealing rings are arranged in the sealing ring seats Compared with a mode that a seal is directly arranged at the connecting position of the two inner rings the sealing performance of the connecting position of the two inner rings is greatly improved and gear oil in the drive axle housing is prevented from possibly passing through a gap between the inner hole of the bearing and the shaft tube and then entering the bearing through the gap between the two bearings
