The invention discloses a highprecision pantilt control and implementation method based on subdivision driving and particularly relates to the technical field of pantilt control An address and acommunication rate of a pantilt are configured through a system parameter configuration unit according to selection of a dial switch and then a universal PelcoD protocol is received through an RS communication unit to control the pantilt According to the highprecision pantilt control and implementation method based on subdivision driving through cooperation of the embedded microcontrolunit the RS communication unit the system parameter configuration unit and the stepping motor subdivision driving unit subdivision driving of a stepping motor is adopted to achieve driving of the motor and through the acceleration and deceleration algorithm of the motor and the switching algorithm of the subdivision data in the movement process of the motor highprecision and stable control over the pantilt is achieved and the requirements of the pantilt for the precision and stability of the pantilt in a special application scene are greatly improved
