The invention discloses a multiconductor signal coupler relates to an information communication accessory and aims to solve the problems that people need to connect an external power supply when using the coupler and the coupler is inconvenient for people to use The key technical points are that the multiconductor signal coupler comprises a signal input module used for connecting a signal source to receive an input signal as a pulse signal the coupling unit is connected with the signal input module and responds to the input signal to output a transmission signal the signal amplificationcircuit is connected with the coupling unit and is used for receiving the transmission signal to amplify the transmission signal the power supply unit is coupled with the signal input module and thesignal amplification circuit and is used for receiving an input signal to drive the signal amplification circuit The coupler can be normally used without an external power supply or a builtin battery or other power supplies by converting an input signal into an internally driven power supply is convenient for people to install and use forms a plurality of mutually independent signal channelsthrough the arrangement of the plurality of photoelectric coupling circuits and is higher in integration level
