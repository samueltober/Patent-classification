 CNU The utility model discloses a kiln car ferry vehicle capable of bearing and automatically adjusting balance in the field of kiln car ferry vehicles Support saddle four groups of supporting pulleys are symmetrically arranged at the front end and the rear end of the bottom of the supporting saddle a driving groove is formed in the middle of the supporting saddle a driving shaft horizontally penetrates through the side walls of the front end and the rear end of the driving groove driving wheels fixedly sleeve the front end and the rear end of the driving shaft first belt wheels are fixedlyarranged in the middle of the driving shaft in a frontback symmetry and sleeving mode The adjusting motor operates and rotates to drive the doublethread screw to rotate the two groups of adjustingblocks get close to each other therefore the compression spring is contracted the elastic force of the compression spring is increased so that the stress distance between the two sets of slidingblocks is controlled the acting force of the adjusting mechanism of the set is increased the horizontal height is properly increased the top area of the whole device is horizontal operation is more stable borne objects are not prone to inclining or falling off and popularization of the device is facilitated
