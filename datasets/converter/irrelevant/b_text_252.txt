 CNB The invention relates to a modular multilevel converter differential smooth nonlinear control method and device under unbalanced power grid voltage The method comprises the steps S collecting theinformation of a power grid and obtaining the positive sequence daxis voltage and the positive sequence qaxis voltage of a current alternating current side power grid based on the information of the power grid S obtaining a positive sequence active reference current and a positive sequence reactive reference current through a feedforward PI feedback control mode and S controlling the positive sequence daxis voltage and the positive sequence qaxis voltage of a modular multilevel converter based on the positive sequence active reference current and the positive sequence reactive reference current Compared with the prior art the nonlinear characteristic of the modular multilevel converter can be directly compensated approximate processing on the system is avoided and the reference track can be tracked more accurately
