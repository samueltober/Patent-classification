 CNA The invention relates to a train power distribution method and device and a computer readable storage medium The method comprises the following steps of distributing the total power of the train toeach bullet train by taking the minimum longitudinal impact as a target according to a running planning curve and running route information of the train and the train state of each bullet train further distributing the given power distributed to the bullet train to each power unit of the bullet train by taking the optimal converter system state as a target according to the states of the plurality of power units of each bullet train and executing the given power distributed to the power unit to the maximum extent according to the wheel rail adhesion state of each power unit Asynchronous collaborative optimization can be carried out on power distribution of all marshalling vehicles according to the dynamic states of all marshalling vehicles of the train and therefore multitarget traction optimization control over the maximum traction exertion the minimum longitudinal impact the optimal converter system state and the like of the train is achieved
