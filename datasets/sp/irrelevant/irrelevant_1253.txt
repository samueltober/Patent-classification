 USA An air spring assembly for a vehicle having a damper body which is decoupled from the bellow of a piston allowing the damper to rotate freely without inducing torsion into the piston The design includes a twopiece piston having both an inner piston and an outer piston which are connected together and a portion of the inner piston is positioned over the damper tube The piston having the twopiece design allows for the twopiece piston to fully decouple from the damper without leakage The inner piston retains a rotary Oring which seals to a damper rod to keep air within the air spring assembly The air spring assembly also includes a thrust bearing located between the inner piston and the top surface of the damper tube The thrust bearing allows full decoupling from the inner piston and the damper ensuring that there is no torsion translated to the bellow
