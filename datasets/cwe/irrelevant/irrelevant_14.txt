 USA A rear axle system keeps rear wheels turning on the same axis when they are fixedly attached to the axles One embodiment of the present invention fixedly attaches an axle to each rear wheel Each of the axles extend through a self aligning pillow block bearing to almost the center of the vehicle The bearings are mounted to the outer portion of the frame on each side and there is a tube that encases the two axles The inner diameter of the tube is large enough to allow the two axles to turn with respect to each other but small enough to keep the two axles turning on the same axis When the vehicle is traveling in a straight line the tube is turning with the axles When the vehicle is turning there is little difference in speed and no requirement for bearings between the axles and the rigid tube
