The invention discloses a multiphase motor faulttolerant online switching channel transition process control method According to the method the nonstop operation of a faulttolerant online switching channel is enabled when one or some channels break down During the removal process of channel faults or faulty channels the stable control over the DC bus voltage of a converter responsible for the residual operation of nonfault channels the shunt protection for the bridge arms of the converter and motors and a comprehensive coordination control scheme for the field suppression of multiple phases of motors are implemented Based on the method the traversing operation of the multichannel rapid stable and safe faulttolerant online switching channel transition process of multiplephases of motors can be realized The method can be applied to highpower electromechanical energy conversion occasions such as ship propulsion track traction and wind power generation
