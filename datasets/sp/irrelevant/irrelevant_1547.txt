 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of robots in particular to a robot damping device and a wheel set structure with the damping device The damping device comprises an adjustable structure and a plurality of damping mechanisms the elastic force range can be adjusted according to the inspection environment of the robot impact force borne by the wheel set structure can be bufferedabsorbed and digested step by step the whole buffering and damping process is more stable and more effective impact and vibration of the wheel set structure from the ground are buffered and the service life of the wheel set structure is prolonged Stable operation of the robot body is ensured and structural damage to all circuit parts in the robot body is effectively reduced According to thewheel set structure with the damping device the upper fork arm the lower fork arm and the damping device form a doubleforkarm structure the weight of the robot body can be effectively shared theimpact force borne by the wheel set structure from the ground is relieved and the suspension type wheel set structure can more flexibly carry the robot body to conduct inspection work in various complicated and severe environments such as pits and soil slopes
