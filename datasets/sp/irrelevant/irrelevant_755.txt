 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle suspensions and discloses an active suspension control method In the running process of the vehicle a front road is observed to obtain an unevenness curve of the road and the posture of the vehicle which needs to be kept is estimated when the vehicle runs to the road surface and has smoothness so as to obtain an expected value of the posture of the vehicle body the active suspension controller calculates compensation information according to the road surface unevenness curved surface and obtains a suspension attitude instruction through calculation in combination with the current vehicle attitude state when the vehicle runs to the uneven road surface the active suspension controller sends a suspension attitude instruction to the chassis controller the chassis controller controls the actuating mechanisms of the suspensions to independently adjust the corresponding suspensions so that the vehicle can adapt to the fluctuation change of the road surface the good smoothness of the whole vehicle is kept and the riding comfort of the vehicle is improved Meanwhile the invention further discloses an active suspension control system
