 CNA The present invention relates to a switched mode power supply with multimode operation and a method therefor In one form a method for generating a drive signal for a switch in the switched mode power supply includes receiving a feedback signal generating a feedback voltage in response to the feedback signal modulating a pulse width of the drive signal in response to the feedback voltage and amode signal generating a modulate signal in response to a magnitude of the feedback voltage crossing a first level in a first direction generating the mode signal in response to the magnitude of the feedback voltage crossing a second level different from the first level in a second direction and varying a gain between the feedback signal and the feedback voltage in response to the mode signal
