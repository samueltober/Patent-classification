 CNA     The invention discloses a cascade utilization energy storage system whose power can be input step by step The existing cascade batteries are unstable in terms of discharge rate selfreliability battery consistency etc due to the difference between new and old batteries The problem is to collect the data of the power grid bus through the data processing device determine the current working status of the power grid and predict the power demand of the power grid bus in the future and report the high power demand to the monitoring device to make it match the preset power threshold By comparing the power directionality judgment is made According to the judgment result the control command is sent to control the operation status and power direction of each power conversion subdevice in the multilevel power conversion device and the number of power conversion subdevices is flexibly controlled thereby The output power of the power converter is controlled to achieve the effect of stepbystep input and avoid problems such as excessive discharge rate excessive temperature and poor consistency caused by differences in battery quality
