 CNA The invention discloses a steering mechanism a steering wheel assembly and a vehicle The steering mechanism comprises a matched mounting structure a driving structure a shock absorber assembly anda bearing assembly A matching protruding part is formed in the middle of the matched mounting structure a mounting groove is formed in the top of a shock absorber base the matching protruding partis rotatably matched in the mounting groove a connecting column penetrates through the matching protruding part and is connected with the driving structure and the driving structure drives the shock absorber assembly to rotate and a first bearing is arranged between the matching protruding part and the mounting groove and a second bearing is arranged between the matching protruding part and the connecting column to make the shock absorber assembly rotate relative to the matching mounting structure The arrangement position of the steering mechanism is not limited the occupied arrangementspace is smaller the steering mechanism can be more conveniently arranged on a vehicle body and wheels can be driven to conduct independent steering so as to effectively increase the rotating angles of the wheels so the steering driving modes of the wheels are increased and then the steering performance of the vehicle is effectively improved
