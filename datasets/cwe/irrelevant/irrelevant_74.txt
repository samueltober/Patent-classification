 CNU The utility model provides a halfaxle support and an automobile The half shaft support comprises an outer support an inner support and an inner support and the adjusting mechanism is arranged in the outer support and used for being connected with the bearing so as to adjust the relative position of the bearing and the outer support According to the utility model the relative positions of thebearing and the outer bracket are adjusted through the adjusting mechanism the bearing is coaxial with the output axis of the transmission nonstrict dimensional tolerance strict control of machining and assembling precision is not needed by means of adjustment of the adjusting mechanism noncoaxiality between the bearing and the output axis of the transmission can be prevented the machining difficulty of the halfshaft support is greatly lowered the yield of the halfshaft support is increased then damage to the bearing due to noncoaxiality between the bearing and the output axis ofthe transmission is avoided and normal work of a transmission system is effectively guaranteed
