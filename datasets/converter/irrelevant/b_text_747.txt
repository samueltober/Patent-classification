 CNA The invention provides a lightweight hybrid converter topology suitable for offshore wind power delivery and a control strategy of the lightweight hybrid converter topology Largescale fans are gathered to an offshore alternatingcurrent bus through a converter an offshore converter carries out rectification an onshore converter carries out inversion through a directcurrent cable and then the current is connected to an alternatingcurrent power grid The offshore converter adopted by the invention comprises an active commutation type current source converter CSC and a diode rectifier DR wherein the CSC is cascaded with the DR In the wind power plant starting stage the CSC establishes an offshore alternatingcurrent voltage to realize power return in the power generation sendingout stage of the wind power plant a fan converter and an offshore sending terminal CSC jointly control active power and alternating voltagefrequency and an onshore receiving terminal converter adopts constant direct voltage control The technical scheme provided by the invention has the advantages that the CSC can supply power to the passive system to realize black start of the offshore windplant the sending terminal converter adopts CSC and DR cascade connection the size and the weight of the offshore platform can be reduced and therefore the cost is reduced
