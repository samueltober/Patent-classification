A system for generating multigated poweron control signals comprises a multigated input  output interface multigated I  O interface configured to receive at least first and second gating signals  and a gated poweron control signal generator gated POC control signal generator configured to generate at least the first and second gating signals for the multigated I  O interface wherein a waveform of the first gating signal is derived from a waveform of the second gating signal differs
