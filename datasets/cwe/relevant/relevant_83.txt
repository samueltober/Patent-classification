 CNB     The subject of the present invention is to provide a wheel bearing device that minimizes the increase in overall weight and reduces the amount of deformation of the opening of the outer member to prevent the reduction in rolling fatigue life The wheel bearing device  includes an outer member  integrally provided with a body mounting flange e and integrally formed with doublerow outer rolling surfaces c d and an inner member which It includes a hub ring  integrally provided with a wheel mounting flange b for mounting a wheel and formed with a smalldiameter step portion a extending in the axial direction and at least one of the smalldiameter step portion a being pressed into Inner ring  the inner member is formed with a doublerow inner rolling surface c a opposed to the doublerow outer rolling surface c d in the opening  of the outer member  At least a part of the outer peripheral portion on the wheel mounting flange b side of b is provided with a beltshaped portion f that protrudes in the radial direction by a predetermined width that is a belt width w
