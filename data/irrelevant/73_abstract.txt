Resonant power converters that replace the conventional impedance matching stage with series or parallel connections between resonant inverters and resonant rectifiers are provided Two or more resonant rectifiers can be connected in series or in parallel to the resonant inverter to provide impedance matching Similarly two or more resonant inverters can be connected in series or in parallel to the resonant rectifier to provide impedance matching Electrical isolation of DC voltage between input and output is provided using only capacitors
