 CNB The invention discloses an automatic speed changing logistics trolley comprising a machine body A speed changing space is arranged in the machine body A transmission space is arranged on the upper side of the speed changing space a damping space is formed in the right side of the transmission space shockproof spaces are arranged on the left side of the speed changing space in a frontback symmetry mode Lifting arm sliding grooves are formed in the upper side of the shockproof spaces in a bilateral symmetry mode with the transmission space as the symmetry center According to the invention the driving speed of the trolley can be automatically adjusted by effectively utilizing the load on the trolley and thus the danger of rollover caused by overlarge inertia due to overweight bearingand rapid driving is effectively avoided and meanwhile the antivibration and damping driving wheels further guarantee the stability of the articles in the transportation process The automatic speed changing logistics trolley adapts to various uneven road surfaces to guarantee that the articles can be stably transported on the rugged road surfaces and the situation that the transported articles are damaged due to jolting in the transportation process does not need to be worried about
