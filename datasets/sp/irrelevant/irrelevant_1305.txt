 CNU The utility model provides a cross brace rod of a nonindependent suspension of a vehicle the nonindependent suspension and the vehicle and the cross brace rod of the nonindependent suspension ofthe vehicle comprises a rod body which comprises a first rod section and a second rod section telescopic structure the bolt is connected between the first rod section and the second rod section thetelescopic structure comprises a driving structure a first transmission structure and a second transmission structure wherein the driving structure drives the first transmission structure to rotate the first transmission structure is matched with the second transmission structure to convert rotation motion into linear motion so as to change the length of the transverse supporting rod or the driving structure can drive the first transmission structure to move relative to the second transmission structure so as to change the length of the transverse supporting rod By the adoption of the technical scheme the problem that in the prior art a vehicle is prone to sideslip due to the fact that the transverse supporting rods are stressed in the steering or aligning or bumping process of wheels of the vehicle can be effectively solved
