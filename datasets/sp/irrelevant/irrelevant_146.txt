 CNB The invention discloses a suspension and a vehicle The suspension comprises a damper a damping spring  a spring upper base  a spring lower base  a driving motor  a ball screw  and a screw nut  wherein the damping spring is sheathed on a piston rod of the damper and is elastically supported between the spring upper base and the spring lower base the ball screw is fixed on a cylinder barrel  of the damper the screw nut is matched on the ball screw the spring lower base is connected to the screw nut and the driving motor is used for driving the screw nut to rotate so as to enable the screw nut to drive the spring lower base to move up and down along the ball screw When the height of a vehicle body needs to be adjusted the driving motor can be utilized for driving the screw nut to rotate and the screw nut moves up and down along the ball screw while rotating thereby driving the spring lower base to move up and down and because the distance between thespring lower base and the vehicle body is certain the vehicle body can move up and down so as to change the height of the vehicle body
