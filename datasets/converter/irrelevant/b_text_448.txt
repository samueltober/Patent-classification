 CNA A regional energy internet reliability evaluation method considering multivariate energy storage comprises the steps establishing mathematical models of all devices in a regional energy internet respectively wherein the devices in the energy internet comprise a combined heat and power generation unit a powertogas conversion device and a power storage battery establihsing mathematical modelsof a natural gas subsystem and a thermal subsystem in the energy internet selecting regional energy internet reliability evaluation indexes analyzing regional energy internet faults and carrying out regional energy internet reliability evaluation considering multivariate energy storage According to the invention a research object of reliability evaluation can be expanded from a parklevel comprehensive energy station to a regionallevel energy internet and the influence of multivariate energy storage resources on reliability evaluation is comprehensively considered so that the planningand operation of the regionallevel energy internet are reasonably guided in addition the fault chain reaction between different energy subsystems is considered and the mutual influence after the faults of the energy subsystems can be effectively recognized and avoided
