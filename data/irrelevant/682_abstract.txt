The invention belongs to the technical field of electricity and relates to a singletube inversion inductive coupling electric energy transmission device and a control method thereof After passing through a power frequency rectifier bridge and a power frequency filter capacitor the power frequency alternating current is converted into direct current and then the direct current is inverted intohighfrequency alternating current through a first field effect transistor and a second field effect transistor the highfrequency alternating current is respectively applied to two ends of transmitting coils of a primary side first resonance network and a secondary side second resonance network current is induced at two ends of a receiving coil of a secondary side resonance network the currentis changed into required direct current after passing through the secondary side resonance network and a highfrequency rectifying circuit and finally a storage battery is charged The device is simple in control and low in switching loss the doubleinput singleoutput structure can achieve highpower transmission the voltage borne by a single switching tube is reduced and meanwhile the requirement for constantcurrent and constantvoltage charging of the storage battery can be met
