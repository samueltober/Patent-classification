 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of unmanned driving and relates to a drivebywire chassis system of a fourwheel independent steering unmanned vehicle which comprises a vehicle body framework a plurality of suspension systems and a plurality of steering systems arranged below the vehicle body framework and each suspension system corresponds to one steering system Each suspensionsystem comprises a linear bearing mechanism a rotary damping mechanism and a spring buffer mechanism the two ends of each rotary damping mechanism are fixed to the vehicle body framework and the steering system respectively and the upper end and the lower end of the spring buffer mechanism are elastically connected to the upper end of the linear bearing mechanism and the top of the steering system respectively Movement of the steering system can be restrained through the linear bearing mechanism so that the steering system only moves in the vertical direction the antirotation effect onwheels in the damping process is achieved and the buffer spring and the rotary damping mechanism work at the same time so as to effectively absorb energy generated by shaking of the vehicle
