 CNA The invention discloses an automobile transverse stability and active suspension multitarget integrated control method based on an observer A state feedback controller of gain scheduling is constructed on the basis of the observer under the condition that timevarying longitudinal speed is considered the tire cornering stiffness is considered as an uncertain variable under the condition that the tire cornering stiffness is limited by actuator saturation and suspension design yawing moment required to be provided and control force of an active suspension are calculated through a constructed state feedback controller the four control parameters of the mass center slip angle the yaw velocity the automobile body vertical acceleration and the automobile body pitch angle acceleration arecontrolled so that the maneuverability of the automobile is improved the transverse stability performance and the riding comfort of the automobile are improved and the possibility of dangerous situations in the automobile running process is reduced
