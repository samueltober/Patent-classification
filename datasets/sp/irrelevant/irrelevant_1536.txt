 USB A suspension system includes a primary actuator an inertial actuator and a controller The primary actuator applies force between a sprung mass and an unsprung mass of a vehicle to control movement therebetween The inertial actuator applies force between the unsprung mass and a reaction mass to damp movement of the unsprung mass The inertial actuator has a threshold capacity The controller controls the primary actuator and the inertial actuator The controller determines a required damping of the movement of the unsprung mass and apportions the required damping between the primary actuator and the inertial actuator
