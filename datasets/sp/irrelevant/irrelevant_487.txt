 CNA The invention discloses a torsion rod spring a suspension system and a vehicle The torsion rod spring is used for the suspension system and comprises a lowrigidity torsion rod and a highrigiditytorsion rod the highrigidity torsion rod comprises a first torsion rod part and a second torsion rod part a tooth groove is formed in a first end of the first torsion rod part teeth are arranged at a first end of the second torsion rod part and are arranged in the tooth groove the firs torsion rod part and the second torsion rod part are both hollow rods the lowrigidity torsion rod is positioned in the first torsion rod part and the second torsion rod part and the two ends of the lowrigidity torsion rod are fixedly connected with a second end of the first torsion rod part and a second end of the second torsion rod part a first end of the torsion rod spring is fixed with a first side of a lower cross arm of the suspension system and a second end of the torsion rod spring is rotationally connected to a vehicle body Firstly the lowrigidity torsion rod is deformed in use to achieve good sitting comfort and when the lowrigidity torsion rod is torsionally deformed to a certain degree the teeth of the second torsion rod part are in butt joint with the groove wall of the tooth groove of the first torsion rod part so that the rigidity of the whole suspension system is improved and the tilting stability is improved
