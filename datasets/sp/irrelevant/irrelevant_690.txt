 DEA     The present invention initially relates to a method for actuating at least one active electromechanical or hydraulic roll stabilizer of a motor vehicle In a step of the method it is checked whether a vertical acceleration of a suspension of a wheel of the motor vehicle exceeds a limit value while the motor vehicle is driving on a road over an unevenness  and undergoes a vertical deflection which leads to a vertical vibration   leads the suspension of the respective wheel of the motor vehicle A point in time is determined at which the vertical vibration  of the suspension of the wheel of the motor vehicle has passed through a first period this point in time forming a control start point in time  According to the invention the active roll stabilizer is activated from the control start time  in order to counteract the vertical vibration  of the suspension of the respective wheel of the motor vehicle from a second period of this vertical vibration Furthermore the invention relates to a control unit for controlling at least one active electromechanical or hydraulic roll stabilizer of a motor vehicle
