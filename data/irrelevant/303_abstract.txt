The invention provides a cascaded lightemitting diode light string with low power consumption which includes a main light string and at least one sublight string wherein the main light string receives a carrier lightemitting signal to control a lightemitting diode module to emit light the sublight string is cascaded with the main light string a signal intensifier of the sublight string enhances the carrier lightemitting signal to drive the lightemitting diode module to emit light and when the voltage of the carrier lightemitting signal is lower than the low level voltage the lightemitting diode module enters a low power consumption mode
