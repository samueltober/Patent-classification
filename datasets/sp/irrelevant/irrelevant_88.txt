 CNB The invention provides an independent front suspension device for a vehicle which is characterized in that a spiral spring a vibration absorber and a steering knuckle are connected to a supporting seat with a semiopen structure through a main pin and the supporting seat is connected to a frame so as to realize guidance and orientation the steering knuckle is movably connected to a cylinder or damping piston rod of the vibration absorber and slides up and down along the main pin so as to realize a vibration absorption function the steering knuckle also swings around the main pin while sliding up and down along the main pin so as to realize steering the spiral spring sleeves outside the vibration absorber the lower end of the spiral spring is connected with the steering knuckle through a bearing and the upper end of the spiral spring is connected with the supporting seat so as to realize buffering and bearing functions and a set of the device is respectively connected at the left and right of the front section of the vehicle to form an independent front suspension system The structure is simple the manufacturing cost is low the space occupation is small suspensions are simple and reliable in guidance and orientation the transverse stiffness of the suspensions is good and the vehicle stability and driving comfort are good so that the independent front suspension device can be used for front and rear independent suspensions of various vehicles
