 CNU The utility model provides a wheel hub a pipe hole in the wheel hub is a spline hole matched with a ball cage spline shaft a connecting hole connected with a brake disc and a rim is arranged on a hub disc and a draining shallow groove arranged along the circumferential direction is arranged on the circumferential surface of a pipe column assembled and connected with a step counter bore part onthe inner side of the brake disc on the outer side of the hub disc According to the scheme the draining shallow grooves are formed in the tubular column of the hub to guide water flowing to the upper portion of the cylindrical surface of the tubular column of the hub to the lower portion of the cylindrical surface of the tubular column then the water flows out of the gap between the contact surfaces of the rim and the brake disc water flow is prevented from flowing to the locking nut of the ball cage and threads on the head of the ball cage and therefore rust water is reduced
