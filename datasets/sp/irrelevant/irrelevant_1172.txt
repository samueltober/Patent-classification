 CNA     A shock absorber system that may include at least one sensor configured to measure operating parameters of the shock absorber during operation of the buffer device The operating parameter may include one or more of pressure temperature the position of the piston rod of the shock absorber the speed of the piston rod andor the acceleration of the piston rod The system may be configured to evaluate the measured operating parameter data and predict the life of the shock absorber andor detect failures
