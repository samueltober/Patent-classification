 CNU The utility model provides a shock absorption driving device for an AGV and the AGV The shock absorption driving device comprises a rotating arm rotationally arranged on a vehicle body bottom platea walking assembly used for driving the walking assembly to walk on the vehicle body bottom plate and a shock absorption mechanism used for elastically abutting against the rotating arm towards the road surface The utility model provides a shock absorption driving device for an AGV and the AGV The driving wheel is installed at one end of the rotating arm the other end of the rotating arm is installed on the vehicle body bottom plate in a rotating mode the damping mechanism is arranged at one end of the rotating arm under the elastic effect of the damping mechanism the driving wheel always keeps enough wheel pressure to make contact with the road surface and the phenomenon that the driving wheel slips on the smooth and flat road surface is avoided And on a concaveconvex uneven road surface the rotating arm can elastically float to reduce shaking so that the running precision of the AGV along the running track and the transportation operation efficiency are improved
