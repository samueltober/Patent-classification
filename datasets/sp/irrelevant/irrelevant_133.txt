 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a vehicular steering device that is able to accurately steer a steering wheel while sufficiently declining an output shaft with respect to an input shaft in a steering mechanismSOLUTION A vehicular steering device  comprises a steering mechanism L that steers a steering wheel and a steering motor L that applies drive force to the steering mechanism L in order to steer the steering wheel The steering mechanism L includes an input shaft  to which drive force from the steering motor L is input an output shaft  that outputs drive force from the input shaft  to the steering wheel and a connection mechanism  that has a first universal joint  and a second universal joint  capable of transmitting drive force from the input shaft  to the output shaft  while declining the output shaft  with respect to the input shaft  and that connects the input shaft  and the output shaft  The output shaft  composes part of a suspensionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
