 CNU The utility model discloses a connecting assembly of a buffer block and an upper connecting plate and a shock absorber The connecting assembly of the buffer block and the upper connecting plate comprises the buffer block and the upper connecting plate A protruding clamping boss is arranged on the inner wall surface of the second part of the upper connecting plate an inward concave clamping groove is formed in the outer wall surface of the part corresponding to the second part of the buffer block the clamping boss is clamped in the clamping groove so as to limit relative movement of the buffer block relative to the second part of the second connecting plate in the axis direction of the buffer block and therefore it is guaranteed that the buffer block plays a role in the rear half section of suspension compression the riding comfort of an automobile is improved and the shock absorber is protected And meanwhile a preset gap is reserved between the inner wall surface of the buffer block and the outer wall surface of the piston rod so that a certain friction buffer space is formed between the buffer block and the piston rod and the problem that the buffer block and the piston rod relatively move to generate friction abnormal sound is effectively solved
