 CNU     The utility model discloses a new type wheel hub bearing which relates to transmission accessories and aims to solve the problem that dust easily enters between the outer ring and the inner ring and is adsorbed on the rolling elements by lubricating oil which affects the service life of the bearing The main points of the technical solution are Yes Including the hub shaft and the outer ring Several rolling elements are slidingly connected between the hub shaft and the outer ring The hub shaft is provided with a flange part that is rotatably connected with the outer ring The flange part is recessed toward the outer ring to form a useful In the dustproof recess at one end of the accommodating outer ring the end of the hub shaft away from the flange is detachably connected with a dustproof ring located in the outer ring The annular recess of the flange portion of the utility model extends the path for external dust to enter the outer ring and an annular groove is provided in the annular recess so that the dust falls into the annular groove when passing through the gap between the flange portion and the outer ring In turn the dust entering the hub bearing is reduced and the dustproof effect of the hub bearing is improved
