A wind farm and a high voltage ride through control method therefor a system an MMC and a machineside inverter The high voltage ride through control method for the wind farm comprises determining the amplitude of an electrical grid voltage  if the amplitude of the electrical grid voltage exceeds a first threshold then determining to enter a high voltage ride through state  acquiring a base frequency modulation wave of a modular multilevel voltage source inverter  superimposing triple harmonics on the base frequency modulation wave to produce a superimposed modulation wave  and controlling on the basis of the superimposed modulation wave the modular multilevel voltage source inverter to work  The technical solution satisfies a high voltage ride through requirement of the wind farm
