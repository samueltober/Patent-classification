This power conversion device is provided with first and second control units   that output first and second control signals respectively gate circuits     that allow control signals selected from the first and second control signals to pass through and a drive circuit  that drives a main circuit  on the basis of the control signals that have passed through the gate circuits If the second control signal is selected while the first control signal has been allowed to pass through the gate circuits block the first control signal and allow the second control signal to pass through in response to the absolute value of the instantaneous value of an alternating current Iuv falling below a threshold current ITH
