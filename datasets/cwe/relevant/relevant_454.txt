 JPA To realize a structure capable of reducing the difference in thickness between a circumferential place where a bottom part of a pocket is located and a circumferential place where a column part is located regarding an inclined crown holderSOLUTION An inclined crown holder  is wholly integrally made of synthetic resin and comprises an annular rim part  and a column part  that protrudes from a plurality of places with equal intervals in a circumferential direction of the rim part  to one side in an axial direction and is inclined radially outward as a central axial line L goes toward the one side in the axial direction Then a portion surrounded on three sides by the rim part  and the pair of column parts  that are adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction serves as a pocket  for rollingly holding a ball The inclined crown holder  has an arc grooveshaped recess  that radially penetrates the rim part  at a circumferential position where the column part  is locatedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
