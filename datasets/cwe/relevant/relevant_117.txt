 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a hub unit capable of reducing rotational resistance of a wheel while restraining reduction in support rigidity of the wheelSOLUTION A hub unit  comprises an outer ring  having a cylindrical part  for forming first and second outside orbital planes a and b on the inner periphery and a fixed flange  projected outward from the cylindrical part  an inner ring member  having a wheel installation flange  for installing a wheel  and forming first and second inside orbital planes a and b opposed to the first and second outside orbital planes a and b on the outer periphery a plurality of rolling elements  arranged between the first and second outside orbital planes a and b and the first and second inside orbital planes a and b and a fastener  for deforming the cylindrical part  of the outer ring  so that an inner diameter in the vehicle longitudinal direction in a mounting state to a vehicle becomes larger than an inner diameter in the vertical directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
