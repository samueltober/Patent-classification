 EPB Provided is a bearing device for a wheel including a bearing  for a wheel including an outer race  having doublerow outer raceway surfaces   formed on an inner circumference thereof a hub wheel  and an inner race  having doublerow inner raceway surfaces   formed on an outer circumference thereof so as to be opposed to the outer raceway surfaces   and doublerow rolling elements   interposed between the outer raceway surfaces   of the outer race  and the inner raceway surfaces   of the hub wheel  and the inner race  the bearing  for a wheel having a constant velocity universal joint  coupled thereto with a screw fastening structure M by fitting a stem section  of an outer joint member  to a shaft hole of the hub wheel  in which the shaft hole  of the hub wheel  is formed by penetrating the hub wheel  into a cylindrical shape over an axial direction of the hub wheel  in which the hub wheel  includes a plurality of concave portions  formed on the shaft hole  thereof by broaching so as to have interferences with convex portions  of the stem section  of the outer joint member  respectively and in which the stem section  of the outer joint member  is pressfitted to the shaft hole of the hub wheel  and a shape of each of the convex portions  is transferred to the shaft hole to thereby define a convex and concave fitting structure in which the convex portions  and the concave portions  are brought into close contact with each other at an entire fitting contact portion therebetween
