 USA The present invention can achieve stable transition between highside and lowside power A DCDC converter is provided with a control unit and a main circuit including a switching circuit and the control unit is provided with three control modes for transition between voltage levels namely a first mode in which a transition period between a pretransition power level and a posttransition power level is implemented by means of constantcurrent control a third mode in which a retention period for holding the voltages of the pretransition power level and the posttransition power level is implemented by means of constantvoltage control and a second mode in which a buffer period from the transition period to the retention period is implemented by means of constantvoltage control The three modes are repeated in sequence so that a directcurrent input is converted to and output as highfrequency pulses at a plurality of different voltage levels
