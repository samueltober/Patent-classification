 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a mounting structure for a hub unit capable of reducing rotational resistance of a wheel while suppressing decline in support rigidity of the wheelSOLUTION A hub unit  includes an outer ring  having a cylindrical portion  in which first and second outer raceway surfaces a b are formed on the inner periphery and a fixation flange  projecting outwards from the cylindrical portion  an inner ring member  that has a wheel mounting flange  mounted with a wheel  and in which first and second inner raceway surfaces a b are formed on the outer periphery and a plurality of rolling elements  In a mounting structure for the hub unit for mounting the hub unit to a knuckle  by using a plurality of bolts  at least any of a mounting surface a of the fixation flange  and a mounting surface a of the knuckle  is formed to have a shape that is deformed by fastening of the bolts  so that an inner diameter in the vehicle longitudinal direction of an end on the wheel  side of the cylindrical portion  is larger than that in the vertical directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
