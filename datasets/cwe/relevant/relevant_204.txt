 EPB A measuring pressing die  is supported by a spherical concave seat  A measuring shaft member  is disposed coaxially with a reference axis  and is linearly guided in a direction of the reference axis  between the measuring pressing die  and a support table  After that the load application apparatus measures an actual load in the direction of the reference axis  applied to the measuring shaft member  using a load cell  in a state in which the measuring pressing die  is pressed against the measuring shaft member  while the measuring pressing die  is rotated about the reference axis
