 EPB A nonisolated transformerless direct currenttodirect current DCDC power supply includes a voltage converter module that converts DC input voltage having a first voltage level into a DC output having a second voltage level that is less than the first voltage level An overvoltage protection module  interposed between the input voltage source and the input to the DCDC converter monitors the DC output and removes power from the voltage converter module if the DC output exceeds an overvoltage threshold A second level of overvoltage protection  that responds faster than the power disconnect module is provided within the DCDC converter PWM controller providing additional overvoltage protection to the DCDC converter and preventing application of the input voltage to the converter output
