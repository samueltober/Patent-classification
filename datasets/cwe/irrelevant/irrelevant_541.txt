 CNA The invention provides a hub unit bearing and belongs to the field of bearings The hub unit bearing comprises a flange outer ring an inner ring two rows of rolling balls and retainers with the corresponding number each row of rolling balls can be evenly separated by the retainers and the hub unit bearing is characterized in that the two rows of rolling balls are the same in structure the inner ring consists of three bearing rings the two rows of rolling balls are arranged in a gap formed by matching a channel on the inner ring with a channel on the flange outer ring and each row of rolling balls is in fourpoint contact with the inner ring and the flange outer ring According to the hub unit bearing the two rows of rolling balls the bearing outer ring and the channel on the inner ring of the bearing form an eightpoint supporting form so that on one hand the contact area is increased through contact points and the bearing performance is improved and on the other hand through the eightpoint supporting form two pressure lines are formed in the axial direction to bear loads and four pressure lines are formed in the radial direction to bear loads so that the bearingcapacity and the moment rigidity are greatly expanded the structure is simple and the use is convenient
