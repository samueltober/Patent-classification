 WOA Disclosed is an intelligent transformer topology in which a small power converter is added to a conventional distribution transformer An intelligent transformer operating in a single phase in which a small power converter is added to a conventional distribution transformer comprises a transformer having a tap on a primary side or a secondary side and a power converter connected to the primary side or secondary side of the transformer The power converter comprises a converter which generates a link voltage by using an output voltage of the transformer and compensates for reactive power a link capacitor unit which is connected in parallel with the converter and stores the link voltage an inverter which is connected in parallel with the converter and the link capacitor unit and outputs a voltage by using the link voltage and a bypass circuit of which one end is connected to one of input stages of the converter and the other end is connected to an output stage of the inverter
