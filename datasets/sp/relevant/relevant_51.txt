 USB A suspension strut bearing includes a top mount The top mount is coupled to a guidance ring wherein relative rotation or oscillation between the guidance ring and the top mount is enabled via rolling elements between an upper raceway and a lower raceway The top mount has a top mount plate with an internal seal and an external seal Both seals are overmolded to the top mounted plate and inhibit debris or the like from interfering with the operation of the rolling elements in the raceways By overmolding the seals a separate cap is no longer needed to be part of the suspension strut bearing Further the upper raceway can be integrated into the top mount plate itself For example the top mount plate can be shaped or formed to take the shape of the upper raceway rather than having a separate element attached to the top mount plate
