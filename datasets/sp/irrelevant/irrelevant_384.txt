 GBB A control unit  for an active suspension system  of a vehicle  having one or wheels  is provided The control unit  comprises at least one input for receiving a signal comprising data related to the topography of terrain in a driving direction of the vehicle  at least one output for outputting a control signal for controlling one or more suspension system actuators  Figure a associated with each respective wheel  and a processing module The processing module is arranged to analyse data to identify a surface feature eg bump or pothole  determine a desired wheel displacement relative to the vehicle body for each wheel  when each wheel  negotiates the surface feature  determine a control signal for suspension system actuators in dependence on the desired wheel displacement The control signal defines future adjustments to the suspension system actuator  that are scheduled to coincide with a time period for which the wheels negotiate the surface feature and output the control signal
