 CNU The utility model relates to a cascaded multilevel rectifier with a public highvoltage directcurrent bus belonging to the ACDC conversion technology and the control technology thereof The converter provides various main power circuits each main power circuit is formed by cascading a plurality of module units and is used for forming a pair of public highvoltage directcurrent buses the voltage stress of a power switch tube is greatly reduced and the defect that a traditional rectifier cannot generate high directcurrent bus voltage due to voltage stress limitation of the power switch tube is overcome The rectifier and the control strategy provided by the utility model balance the voltage of each series capacitor at the output side realize the highpower rectification conversion under high voltage by using the lowwithstandvoltage power switch tube and do not need to use a huge and heavy power frequency phaseshifting transformer with complex wiring for isolation thereby greatly simplifying the topology of the main power circuit and improving the reliability of the main power circuit The system is small in size light in weight and low in cost and has important application value in the fields of mediumhigh voltage direct current transmission highpower mediumhigh voltage frequency converters and the like
