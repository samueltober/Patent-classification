The application discloses a singlepole line overload control method and system for a multiterminal flexible direct current power grid The singlepole line overload control method for the multiterminal flexible direct current power grid specifically comprises that when a singlepole line fault occurs in the direct current power grid the overload phenomenon can be caused on the line at this point the faulty line is first cut off by a direct current breaker and then the power of the sending end converter station of the overload line is transferred to the other pole of the station if theload is still overloaded after the transfer the power of the sending end converter station of the faulty line is transferred to the other pole of the station and if the load is still overloaded after the transfer the power of the sending end converter station of the overload line is reduced until the line overload disappears Through the above operations the power of the power grid can be effectively transmitted and the overload phenomenon can be avoided
