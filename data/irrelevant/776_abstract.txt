An interleaved LLC resonant converter for a vehiclemounted PEV battery charger can be used as a DCDC stage of the vehiclemounted PEV battery charger and is used for deep depletion of a PEV battery The converter uses a doublevoltage circuit to reduce the influence of parasitic capacitance of the transformer and expand the working range of the converter the system has two working modes synchronization and independence In the synchronous mode the two interleaved converters work together at the same frequency and in the independent mode only one converter works In the previous mode the generated gain is twice that in the next mode so that a wider output voltage range can be realized by combining the operation of mode switching and frequency control The converter can realize a wide output voltage range of VV and can reach an output voltage range of VV in an independent mode Through combined frequency and mode change control an output range from V to V can be realized
