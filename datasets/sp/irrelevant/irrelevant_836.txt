 CNB The invention discloses a vehicle active suspension system modeling and control method based on hidden semiMarkov switching relates to a vehicle active suspension system modeling and control methodand aims to solve the problems that an existing active suspension needs to depend on a sensor to adapt to road conditions autonomously and is high in use cost high in failure rate and the like Themethod comprises the following steps a kinetic equation of a vehicle active suspension is established a suspension system is modeled into a nonhomogeneous hidden semiMarkov random switching system and damping and rigidity in the kinetic equation of the vehicle active suspension can be randomly switched in multiple submodes to adapt to different road conditions stability analysis is performed on the vehicle active suspension system and a state feedback controller depending on the observation mode is designed According to actual conditions the active suspension system is modeled intoa nonhomogeneous hidden semiMarkov random switching system and the comfort of the suspension system is improved while the use cost of the suspension system is reduced
