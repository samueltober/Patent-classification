 CNU The utility model provides an oilgas seal structure namely a novel oilgas seal structure of a central inflation and deflation oil seal and solves the problem of abrasion between a shaft and the oil seal The oilgas seal structure comprises a fixing frame a rubber seal ring and a spring the fixing frame is of an annular structure with a Cshaped section and the rubber sealing ring is an annular rubber ring internally provided with a framework The spring is of an annular structure the spring is positioned in an annular groove in the right side of the rubber sealing ring due to the fact that the inside of the oilgas seal rotates in a matched mode the shaft and the fixing frame are relatively fixed the rubber sealing ring and the fixing frame rotate relatively namely the rotation of the hub relative to the shaft portion is converted into the rotation mode inside the oil seal and friction between the shaft and the oilgas seal is avoided Through rotation in the oilgas seal the lip of the oil seal is prevented from being impacted by air pressure and the oilgas seal is prevented from being damaged
