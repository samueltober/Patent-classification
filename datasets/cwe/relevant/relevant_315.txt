 JPA To provide a rolling bearing unit for wheel support which can prevent a large flange part from falling down by reducing hoop stress generating on an outer peripheral surface of the large flange part when the inner ring is pressfitted in a hub ring or when the inner ring is positioned by a caulking part formed at the hub ringSOLUTION In a rolling bearing unit for wheel support a hub  includes a hub ring  having a rotation side flange  and at least one inner ring  externally fitted in an outer peripheral surface of the hub ring  by pressfitting and positioned at the hub ring  by a caulking part  formed on an inboard side end part of the hub ring  At the inner ring  having an inner ring raceway b on the inboard side a plurality of notches  extending in the axial direction from an axial direction inner end surface on a large flange part  respectively are formed intermittently in the circumferential directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
