 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To increase the inclination of an axle hub with respect to a hub carrier when an external force acts on a wheel in an upright of a vehicle    An upright  includes an axle hub  to which wheels  are fixed and a hub carrier  that rotatably supports the axle hub  via bearings  The upright  also includes a hub tilt detector  that detects the tilt of the axle hub  with respect to the hub carrier  A deforming member  is interposed between the bearing holding portion  of the hub carrier  and the outer race  of the bearing  The material of the deformable member  has a Youngs modulus lower than that of the bearing holding portion  Since the deformable member  has low rigidity the axle hub  is likely to be tilted
