Nested neutral point clamped NNPC multilevel power converter stages  and systems  are presented in which the converter stage includes an NPC inverter core circuit  with a flying switched capacitor nesting circuit  with the switches of the NPC core  and the switched capacitor circuit  being gated using selected redundant switching states to control the voltage of the switched capacitors to achieve a multilevel output voltage having equally spaced voltage step values Multiple inverter stages  can meet cascaded or connected in various configurations to implement single or multiphase power conversion systems and higher output voltages can be achieved by forming to converter stages  into an Hbridge configuration and connecting multiple Hbridge stages in series with one another
