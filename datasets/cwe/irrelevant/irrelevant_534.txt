 CNU The inserted hub bearing structure comprises a bearing outer cylinder a convex ring part is arranged on the inner wall of the bearing outer cylinder the two sides of the convex ring part are of inclined plane structures a first inner cylinder and a second inner cylinder are inserted into the two ends of the inner wall of the bearing outer cylinder correspondingly and tubular extending parts are arranged at the opposite ends of the first inner cylinder and the second inner cylinder correspondingly and the outer walls of the two tubular extending parts are sleeved with the same first springpiece inclined plane structures are arranged on the sides close to the convex ring part of the first inner barrel and the second inner barrel and retainers are arranged at the positions close tothe convex ring part of the first inner barrel and the second inner barrel The axial bearing capacity of the bearing is improved meanwhile the first spring piece is arranged in a matched mode the gap between the first inner barrel and the second inner barrel can be conveniently and dynamically adjusted the locking phenomenon is avoided meanwhile the shaft locking assembly is arranged in amatched mode locking with a mounting shaft is facilitated and the connecting stability is improved
