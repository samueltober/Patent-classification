 EPB A hub wheel and an outer joint member are coupled to each other through intermediation of a recessprojection fitting structure The recessprojection fitting structure can be separated by being applied with a pullingout force in an axial direction under a state in which a bolt member is removed and can be reformed by rescrewing the bolt member into a bolt hole The hub wheel comprises a receiving portion for receiving the bolt member A guide portion for guiding the pressfitting of the projection portion is provided at an end portion on a pressfitting start side of the shaft portion of the outer joint member or the hole portion of the hub wheel A length of the bolt member is set so that at reassembly of the recessprojection fitting structure after separation of the recessprojection fitting structure a male threaded portion of the bolt member having a seat surface held in abutment against the receiving surface is free from being engaged with a female threaded portion of the bolt hole until an end portion on the pressfitting start side of the projection portion is fitted to the guide portion This structure makes it possible that the hub wheel and the outer joint member are coupled and recoupled to each other with high accuracy even after being separated from each other
