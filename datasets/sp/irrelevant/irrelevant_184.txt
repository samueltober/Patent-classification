 CNB The invention discloses a Taylor series and composite robust delay compensation control method for a magnetorheological semiactive suspension Delay is written into a firstorder Taylor series and delay equation that forms an augmented state equation with a suspension system state equation predicted control force of next delay moment is used as an input for the firstorder Taylor series and delayequation for the augmented state equation H norm is used to restrain suspension integrated performance index and H norm is used to restrain predicted control force of next delay moment a Taylorseries and HH delay compensation controller is designed and uses a suspension state variable and output of the above firstorder Taylor series and delay equation as an input and predicted controlforce of next delay moment as an output to solve a control current signal a numerical control current source is input to obtain actual control current of a magnetorheological damper and delay compensation control is achieved for the magnetorheological semiactive suspension The method of the invention is effective in responding to the delay problem of vehicular magnetorheological semiactive suspensions
