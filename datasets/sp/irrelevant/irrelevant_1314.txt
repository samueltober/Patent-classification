 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of automobile body height adjustment and particularly relates to an antitipping selfadjusting stabilizing system for an automobile body The systemcomprises a central hydraulic control device and a plurality of vehicle body regulators connected between a chassis and a suspension system or an axle the multiple vehicle body adjusters are symmetrically arranged on the left side and the right side and connected with the central hydraulic control device the central hydraulic control device can drive the vehicle body adjusters on the same side to synchronously ascend and descend and drive the vehicle body adjusters on the other side to synchronously do opposite actions and therefore the vehicle chassis can be obliquely aligned with an oblique vehicle body A central hydraulic control device and vehicle body regulators are adopted and the vehicle body regulators on the same side are driven to synchronously ascend and descend and simultaneously drive the vehicle body regulators on the other side to synchronously do opposite actions The vehicle body is adjusted through the vehicle body adjuster so that the inclined vehicle body is adjusted and kept balanced and stable And accidents of side tipping can be prevented
