 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a wheel bearing device capable of restricting reduction in a rolling fatigue life by restricting a deformation at an opening part of an outer member under application of a rotating loadSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  comprising an outer member  having integrally a vehicle body fixing flange e and integrally formed with plural rows of outer rolling surfaces cd a hub wheel  having integrally a wheel fixing flange b for use in fixing the wheel and formed with a small diameter step part a and one inner member  formed of one inner wheel  fitted to the small diameter step part a of the hub wheel  on which plural rows of inner rolling surfaces a a facing the plural outer rolling surfaces c d are formed and plural rows of rolling bodies a b which are stored so as to roll between the respective rolling surfaces The vehicle body fixing flange e of the outer member  is formed in such a way that a center part between an inner side end and an outer end in an axial direction is positioned more outer side than a center part between an inner end and an outer end of the outer member  in its axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
