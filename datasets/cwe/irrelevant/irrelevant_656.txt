 CNU The hub with the auxiliary damping effect comprises a steel ring aluminum alloy is fixedly connected to the periphery of the front end of the steel ring an axis wheel is movably connected to the end away from the steel ring of the aluminum alloy through a bearing seat a shaft sleeve is fixedly connected to the right side of the axis wheel and dustproof plates are arranged at the top and the bottom of the shaft sleeve Bolts are arranged on the periphery of the front end of the shaft sleeve the back ends of the bolts penetrate through the front end of the shaft sleeve and damping mechanisms are fixedly connected to the top and the bottom of the axis wheel According to the utility model different positions are stressed by contacting with the ground in the rolling process of the test steel ring and the faster the steel ring rotates the larger the vibration is The wheel hub solves the problem that an existing wheel hub is not provided with a damping structure so that the wheel hub cannot be damped under pressure and is prone to deformation the service life of the wheel hub is prolonged and the cost for producing the wheel hub is reduced
