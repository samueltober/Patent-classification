 JPA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device for a wheel which secures high sealing performance while suppressing an increase of the rotation torque of a seal prevents the leakage of a grease and is improved in the durability of a bearingSOLUTION A seal  is composed of a slinger  and a seal plate  which oppose each other and the slinger  comprises a cylinder part a which is externally fit to an inner ring  an erecting plate part b which extends to the outside of a radial direction and an umbrella part d which is bent in an Lshape from an outer edge along an end part of an outer member  via a bent part c A seal member  comprises first and second side lips b c which are branched from a base part a into a twofork shape slidably contact with the erecting plate part b with an axial margin and extend so as to be inclined to a radial direction An annular recess  is formed at an internal periphery of an end part of the outer member  and the recess an end face c and an external peripheral face of the end part and the bent part c of the slinger  and the umbrella part d are oppositely arranged with a clearance having a lateral Ushape in a cross section thus constituting a labyrinth part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
