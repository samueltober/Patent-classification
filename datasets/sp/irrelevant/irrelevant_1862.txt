 CNU     The utility model provides a fourwheeled robot platform with independent suspension which includes a robot platform upper plate an independent suspension system a robot platform lower plate a motor back seat a motor front seat a loadbearing aluminum frame a DC motor a coupling and a full To wheels the independent suspension system is mechanically positioned by parallel slide rails and sliding blocks and four parallel and vertical spring shock absorbers are used to ensure that the fourwheel robot platform keeps the four wheels in contact with the ground at the same time while working  The spring shock absorber is hinged to the upper ear fixedly connected to the upper plate of the robot platform and hinged to the lower ear fixedly connected to the bottom plate and a certain buffer stroke of the spring shock absorber is used to reduce the movement of the fourwheeled robot platform shock By configuring an independent suspension system for one wheel train of the fourwheeled robot platform the utility model not only solves the problem that it is difficult for all wheels of more than three wheel trains to keep in contact with the ground at the same time but also makes the fourwheeled robot platform work more smoothly and efficiently
