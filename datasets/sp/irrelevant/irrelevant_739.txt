 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle distributed driving and discloses an active suspension structure of a distributed driving vehicle The active suspension structure comprises anIshaped frame a connecting bottom rod a connecting top rod a hub motor a reservedVshaped connecting rod a suspension device and a support device Through the mutual connection effect of the Ishaped frame the connecting bottom rod the connecting top rod and the suspension device a tire driven by the hub motor can lift an obstacle encountered in front during the traveling process of anautomobile and the collision between the tire and the obstacle can be effectively reduced so that the vibration caused to the hub motor is reduced the protection strength of the hub motor is improved the service life of the hub motor is effectively prolonged meanwhile damage caused by collision to the tire is reduced and the wear rate of the tire is reduced and through intelligent controlafter wheels on one side are lifted up and lowered the wheels on other side are lifted up seamless connection is achieved and the use safety of the hub motor is effectively improved
