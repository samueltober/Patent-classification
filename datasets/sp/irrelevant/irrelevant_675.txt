 KRA The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a suspension strut bearing of a unitary convergence type The method is able to thoroughly block foreign matter from the outside simply install a damping unit and significantly reduce equipment failure and damage by manufacturing a housing and the damping unit in a united body while installing the damping unit in the outside of the lower surface of a flange and a lower body of the housing by a third mold injection step The method is able to increase a production rate and reduce unnecessary costs by simplifying processes and shortening process time since the damping unit is not manufactured with a separate independent component but manufactured by being injectionmolded with the housing and a sealing unit in a united body for a separate coupling process not to be necessary to couple the damping unit with the housing The method is able to significantly reduce defect rates by significantly solving problems of high defect rates during a coupling process as an existing coupling process is omitted effectively prevents the tear damage and wear of the damping unit due to rotation by applying the damping unit injectionmolded by the third mold injection step to thermoplastic polyurethane TPU and maximizing the durability and wear resistance of the damping unit and is able to remarkably increase the adhesiveness and adhesion of the housing and the damping unit through a simple structure change
