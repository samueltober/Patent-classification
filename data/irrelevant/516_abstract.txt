The invention discloses a multiscale inertia control method based on converter gridconnected equipment and an additional controller The method comprises steps of dividing a control module of the converter gridconnected equipment into a DC voltage control scale module and an AC current control scale module according to the time response speed during disturbance enabling the terminal voltage qaxis component under the phaselocked coordinate system to respectively pass through filters and signal conversion modules of different frequency bands and outputting control signals corresponding tothe control modules of different time scales lowfrequencyband control signals and highfrequencyband control signals being respectively attached to an active branch of a directcurrent voltage control scale module and a reactive branch of an alternatingcurrent current control scale module Therefore different response degrees of the activereactive branches of the converter gridconnected equipment to different time scale signals of the system are fully utilized and inertia support is efficiently and harmoniously provided for different time scales of the system in addition the numberof sensors is not additionally increased and the activereactive power injected into the power grid by the converter gridconnected equipment in a steady state is changed
