 CNU     The utility model discloses a balance suspension structure which includes a balance suspension support an axle assembly a leaf spring and also includes a thrust rod and a thrust rod support The thrust rod support is fixed on the axle assembly  The two ends of the thrust rod are respectively hinged with the balance suspension support and the thrust rod support through a pin shaft and the angle between the axis of the thrust rod and the horizontal line is  to  and the plate spring is in the process of compression and deformation The end of the thrust rod connected to the thrust rod support is always lower than the end connected to the balance suspension support The balanced suspension structure optimizes the working angle of the lower thrust rod reduces the vertical component force of the thrust rod and at the same time strengthens the key loadbearing parts so that this type of suspension is suitable for the drive axle group of the heavy special chassis
