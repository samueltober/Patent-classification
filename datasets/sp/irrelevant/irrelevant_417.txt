 WOA An active suspension device  for a vehicle  for controlling on the basis of the traveling state of the vehicle  the damping force of variableforce dampers a b c d that are provided between a sprung mass and an unsprung mass for each of multiple wheels  of the vehicle  The active suspension device  comprises acceleration sensors    that detect bobbing at the center of gravity location of the sprung mass of the vehicle  and an active suspension control unit  that controls the damping force of the multiple variableforce dampers a b c d on the basis of the bobbing at the center of gravity location The damping force of the variableforce dampers a b c d is controlled so as to mitigate from the bobbing in the center of gravity location vertical movement at the center of gravity location of the vehicle
