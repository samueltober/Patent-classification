 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a hub unit capable of configuring a seal part for restricting intrusion of a foreign matter from a space between an outer member and an outer joint member of a constant velocity joint without restricting the design of a knuckleSOLUTION A hub unit  comprises an outer member  mounted on a knuckle  an inner member  to which an outer joint member  of a constant velocity joint  is connected a rolling element  rolling on raceway surfaces formed on the outer member  and the inner member  a magnetic encoder  rotating together with the inner member  and a seal structure part  disposed between the outer member  and the outer joint member  The seal structure part  comprises a sensor holder  which has a sensor holding part  for holding a magnetic field sensor  for detecting a magnetic field of magnetic poles of the magnetic encoder  and a cylindrical part  disposed on an outer periphery of the outer joint member  and is fixed to the outer member  and a deflector  fixed to the outer joint member  and having a largediameter cylinder part  covering at least a part of the cylindrical part  of the sensor holder SELECTED DRAWING Figure
