 CNU The utility model discloses a power electronic transformer structure and belongs to the technical field of power electronics The middle protection switch is formed by connecting three switch groupswhich are opened and closed at the same time in series with an upper output port a clamping midpoint and a lower output port of the cascade rectifier respectively when the power electronic transformer operates normally the intermediate protection switch is in a closed state and the DCDC converter is in a putin state when the directcurrent link of the power electronic transformer fails theintermediate protection switch is quickly disconnected according to the system a level k is generated through carrier stacking calculation and meanwhile the region R where a modulation wave u  islocated is judged establishing an onoff state equation of the n submodule cascade rectifier according to k and R and establishing a first onoff state table the method comprises the following steps acquiring direct current output voltage of each submodule sorting the direct current output voltage carrying out smooth optimization processing on an obtained switch state establishing a second switch state table and matching the switch state in the second switch state table to each submodule thereby completing the reconstruction of a direct current link fault
