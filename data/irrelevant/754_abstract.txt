The invention provides a precise power component management method based on a space grid and a building information model The method comprises the steps establishing a threedimensional earth platform modeling the power component by using the building information model and converting the format of the power component into a file type loaded by the threedimensional earth platform analyzing the power component model to obtain local coordinate information of each power subcomponent in the power component model for each power subcomponent converting the local coordinates into geographic coordinates loading the threedimensional model file of the power component to a threedimensional earth platform according to the geographic coordinates establishing a power component index table performing grid coding on each power subcomponent according to the geographic coordinates and the proportion of each power subcomponent and storing the grid codes as index codes in the power component index table and managing the power components according to the power component index table Fine and efficient management of power components is achieved and the defect that realtime realscene and quantitative dynamic management of the power components cannot be achieved is overcome
