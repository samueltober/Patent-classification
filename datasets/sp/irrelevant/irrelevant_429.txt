 CNB     A valve block for an active chassis damping system of a motor vehicle has a valve housing that limits an internal space and is used to connect with a shock absorber of a wheel suspension system a valve movably guided in the internal space Piston which divides the internal space into a connection space and a control space a connection channel communicating with the connection space for hydraulic connection with the shock absorber volume of the shock absorber and a connection channel communicating with the connection space for connecting with the hydraulic pipe At least one connecting channel connected to the control space a control channel communicating with the control space for applying control pressure in the control space the valve piston having a plug portion for the closing position of the valve piston in the internal space The connecting passage is closed and the connecting passage is opened in the open position of the valve piston in the internal space As a result it can be realized that the hydraulic fluid is temporarily locked into the shock absorber of the active chassis vibration damping system of the motor vehicle in a costeffective and robust manner with only a low risk of erroneous operation
