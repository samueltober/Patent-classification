 EPB A method of manufacturing a rotating bearing unit includes to cause one end surface in the axial direction of the forming punch  formed by combining a plurality of punch elements   divided in the circumferential direction which are displaceable in the axial direction and which are not displaceable in the circumferential direction and having a processing teeth   at one end surface in the axial direction to face the other end surface of the caulking section  in the axial direction In this state rolls a are rotated about the central axis  of the hub main body  while pressing the other end surface of the forming punch  in the axial direction with a pressing surface  of the roll a having a central axis  that is inclined with respect to the central axis  of the hub main body
