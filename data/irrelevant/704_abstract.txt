The invention provides a highreliability miniaturized motor control system for space navigation According to the invention a resistor is pulled up from an external main power supply to a forbiddenend of a backup Hbridge assembly and when the external main power supply externally outputs voltage to a main winding to electrify the main winding and causes activation of a backup Hbridge by a submerged path the forbidden end of the backup Hbridge assembly is connected to the high level of the external main power supply so a switching tube in the backup Hbridge assembly is forbidden to beconducted and the problem of mutual inductance back electromotive force generated by doublewinding electromagnetic coupling is solved and therefore the problem that the main winding of the doublewinding motor works and the standby winding forms a closed loop through magnetic field coupling and a driving loop to generate resistance torque is solved without enlarging the output torque of the motor and adding a relay and compared with a traditional design the reliability of the system in the invention is improved and a circuit scale is reduced The system is suitable for spacecraft electromechanical control systems
