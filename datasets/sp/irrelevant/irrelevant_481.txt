 CNU The utility model provides a steel plate spring support base plate structure The base plate comprises a base plate body of an arch structure The left end and the right end of the base plate body extend in the horizontal direction to form two horizontal connecting sections of plane structures The front end and the rear end of the upper surface of each horizontal connecting section are fixedly connected with the outer surface of the base plate through a vertically arranged rib plate two through holes are formed in the portion located between the two rib plates of each horizontal connectingsection at intervals The lower surfaces of the two horizontal connecting sections are attached to the plane of a steel plate spring support in the axle housing assembly the four through holes are aligned with four threaded holes of the steel plate spring support and screw rods of the four hexagon socket screws penetrate through the four through holes to be screwed into the four threaded holesof the steel plate spring support and are screwed down The weight of the base plate is reduced the inner hexagon screw is adopted a wrench head of an outer hexagon structure can be used during screwing the wrench head does not occupy radial space and does not interfere with a rib plate of the base plate and therefore bolt holes can be formed in the inner sides of the two vertical ribs
