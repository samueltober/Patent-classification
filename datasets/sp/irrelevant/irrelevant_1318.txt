 CNU The utility model provides a front independent suspension system for a light bus The two wheel edge bodies are connected through a steering pull rod A transverse stabilizing rod is connected betweenthe two lower swing arms a vibration reduction stand column is arranged above the lower swing arm By means of unequallength arrangement and longitudinal angle arrangement of the upper swing arm and the lower swing arm small changes of a kingpin inclination angle and a wheel track can be achieved changes of fourwheel positioning parameters can be effectively reduced and tire abrasion is reduced The occupied space of the damping strut is small meanwhile the rigidity of the spiral damping spring can be flexibly adjusted according to the requirement of the whole vehicle the offset frequency of the suspension can be effectively reduced and the driving smoothness and the riding comfort are improved thrust roller pin combination bearings are adopted in the left steering bracket andthe right steering bracket so that the internal friction of the system can be effectively reduced and the steering return performance is improved meanwhile the whole life cycle is free of maintenance in the using process and the operation cost is reduced
