The invention provides a reservoir riverway instant linkage simulation method based on multistep nesting and the method comprises the steps of building a reservoir water and riverway water multistep coupling nesting series model according to target historical information according to the target historical information analyzing correlation between reservoir group regulation and control capability and downstream river channel flood capacity flat beach flow and estuary water level related characterization indexes to determine a reservoir application mode performing dynamic calculation on the reservoir water and the river water based on the constructed reservoir water and river water multistep coupling nested series model judging the river channel scouring and silting state accordingto the downstream river channel flat beach flow and scouring and silting quantity result and adjusting the reservoir application mode in combination with the water and sediment conditions based on the adjusted reservoir application mode and the constructed reservoir water and riverway water multistep coupling nested series model calculating and outputting a dynamic result of the reservoir water and riverway water at the next moment and meanwhile repeatedly executing the step  based on the timestamp Reservoir group scheduling and riverway water and sediment evolution integrated instantlinkage simulation can be realized conveniently
