 USB An active suspension control unit may include an actuator having an active roll stabilization ARS structure to variably adjust response characteristics of a suspension and a controller for determining a driving situation of a vehicle through information input from a sensor and determining a final desired control value of the actuator based on a desired relative suspension vertical force value set in advance according to the driving situation and a difference value generated by a difference between left and right wheels relative suspension vertical velocities
