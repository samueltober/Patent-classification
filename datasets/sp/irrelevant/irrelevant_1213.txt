 CNU Automobile swing arm swing arm comprising a swing arm body the edges of the two sides of the swing arm body are bent in the same direction for the first time Forming a first edge reinforcing wallthe first edge reinforcing walls on the two sides are bent outwards for the second time a second edge reinforcing wall is formed an arcshaped edge is formed at the junction of the first edge reinforcing wall and the second edge reinforcing wall and a bottom reinforcing structure a middle reinforcing structure and an outer end reinforcing structure are arranged between the first edge reinforcing walls on the two sides of the swing arm body the damping swing arm provided by the utility model comprises the first edge reinforcing wall and the second edge reinforcing wall which can enhance the bending resistance and the tensile strength of the swing arm and have good load impact bearing capacity the bottom reinforcing structure the middle reinforcing structure and the outer end reinforcing structure can reinforce the strength between the first edge reinforcing walls on the two sides and the bending angle of the damping mounting hole part is  degrees so that the automobile swing arm can overcome a part of tension generated by the swing arm ball head
