 CNA The invention discloses a formula car for college students The formula car comprises a car frame an engine a transmission system a suspension system and a braking system The rear wheel driving and chain transmission mode is adopted the reasonable axle load distribution condition of the front axle and the rear axle is achieved the chain tensioning mechanism is adopted for tensioning the chain and the situation that the chain is loosened due to vibration in the running process is avoided the doublewishbone type independent suspensions with unequal lengths are adopted and different designs of the front shock absorber and the rear shock absorber are matched so that certain comfort is guaranteed meanwhile good control stability is achieved and the racing car has better competitive performance the leather cup of the front working cavity is limited through the hollow limiting screw and compared with the prior art that a hole is formed in the side face of the brake master cylinder and limiting is conducted through a limiting screw the sealing performance is better and the machining cost is lower
