 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of balance damping mechanisms The utility model relates to a damping mechanism in particular to a balance damping mechanism for AGVs The device comprises a connecting plate connecting pieces located at the two ends of the connecting plate and walking wheels fixed through the connecting pieces a supporting rod is fixedly arranged on the bottom face of the connecting plate a mounting plate is fixedly arranged at the end away from the connecting plate of the supporting rod and a supporting pipe is fixedly arranged on the bottom face of themounting plate universal wheel bumping damping can be achieved under the action of the supporting pipe and the reset spring a bearing plate is arranged above the connecting plate a worker placesan object on the bearing plate the first connecting pipe and the second connecting pipe slide in a matched mode then the damping effect is achieved due to the fact that the damper and the limitingplate are located on the same vertical horizontal plane the silica gel pad is arranged on the limiting plate the silica gel pad is attached to the limiting hole the connecting plate is prevented from being damaged due to the fact that the weight of an object is too large through buffering of the silica gel pad and convenience is brought to workers
