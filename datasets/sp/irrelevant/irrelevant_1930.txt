 DEA Bearing arrangement  comprising a core element  with a hollow cylinder element  an elastic intermediate element  at least partially enveloping the core element and a sleeve element  at least partially enveloping the elastic intermediate element and having a first end piece facing the core element   and a second end piece  arranged at a distance  from the first end piece On the intermediate element a first extension length of the first end piece defines a first overlap region    and a second extension length of the second end piece defines a second overlap region The intermediate element has a first transition area  radially spaced between the first overlap area and the hollow cylinder element and a second transition area radially spaced between the second overlap area and the hollow cylinder element A central region  of the core element is arranged between the first and second end pieces The central area has a rib element  which extends away from the hollow cylinder element and at least partially protrudes into an overlap area Outside the central area between the first and second end pieces the core element has a rib element  which is arranged in one of the transition areas and has a lower height in a radial direction of extent  pointing away from the hollow cylinder element than the rib element arranged in the central area
