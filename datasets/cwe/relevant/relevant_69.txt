 JPA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To obtain a structure which can easily discharge foreign matters intruded from a clearance between an axial outer end face of an outer ring and an axial inside face of a rotationside flangeSOLUTION An outside diameter of an axial outer end face of an outer ring a is set larger than a diameter of an inscription circle of an inner end part of a throughhole a which is formed at a rotationside flange a in a radial direction with a center axis of a wheel support rolling bearing unit a as a center A cross section is set large at a portion in which an insidediameter shifted portion of the throughhole a and the axial outer end face of the outer ring a oppose each other and a speed of an airflow which is generated accompanied by the rotation of the rotationside flange a is decelerated thus increasing pressure in a labyrinth seal SELECTED DRAWING Figure
