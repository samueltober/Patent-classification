 CNU     The utility model belongs to the technical field of auto parts especially the outer ring of a highstrength new energy automobile hub unit The outer ring includes a bearing A baffle is provided on the outer surface of the baffle a limiting plate is provided on one side of the baffle and a sealing gasket is provided on one side of the limiting plate The utility model squeezes the balls inside the outer ring by setting protrusions reduces the risk of axial displacement of the balls solves the problem of the balls moving between the inner ring and the outer ring and makes the rotation of the wheel hub and the bearing more efficient Stable by setting the inner ring with the bearing as the support the reaction force of the two inner rings squeezing the balls increases the contact force between the inner ring and the bearing which solves the problem of the two inner rings and the bearing during relatively fast acceleration The problem of radial slip occurs which reduces the jitter and wear of the bearing when the hub rotates and prolongs the service life of the bearing
