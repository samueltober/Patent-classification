 CNA In the field of automobile suspension traditional hydraulic suspension and electromagnetic suspension can only actively adjust the suspension hardness through road conditions and cannot actively adjust the posture of an automobile body according to the road conditions the active mechanical electric control suspension can actively adjust the posture and height of the automobile body according to the road conditions and traditional hydraulic suspension cylinders control the suspension hardness through hydraulic oil and valves According to traditional electromagnetic suspension the suspension hardness is controlled through the flowing speed of hydraulic oil in principle the suspension hardness is controlled to absorb energy by controlling the flowing speed of the hydraulic oil and the mechanical electric control suspension is of a pure mechanical structure and the compression and springback speed of a spring is controlled through a servo motor Theoretically vibration and resonance of the vehicle body can be more directly and actively controlled meanwhile certain vibration energy can be converted into electric energy to be recycled and energy conservation and emission reduction are facilitated
