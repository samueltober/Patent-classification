 USA The objective of the present invention is to improve the rigidity of a vehicle knuckle made from an aluminum alloy with respect to a force directed from the outside to the inside in the width direction of a vehicle A vehicle knuckle  is provided with a bearing support portion  a knuckle upper portion  and a knuckle lower portion  With the vehicle knuckle  in a position fitted to a vehicle main body the knuckle upper portion  has a shape in which if the knuckle upper portion  is divided equally into five or more regions in a vertical direction and the center of the bearing support portion  is fixed and a horizontal load F is applied to a knuckle upper end portion  from the outside toward the inside in the width direction of the vehicle the minimum value of a value obtained by dividing the strain energy in each of the five or more regions other than a first region A by the mass of the corresponding region is at least equal to  times the maximum value thereof
