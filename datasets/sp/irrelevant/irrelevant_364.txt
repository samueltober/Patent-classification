 CNB The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle chassis and discloses a vehicle steeringrolling linkage device and an active rolling chassis The vehicle steeringrolling linkage device is formed through linkage of rolling mechanisms and a steering mechanism each rolling mechanism comprises a vehicle body a lower pull rod a steering knuckle main spindle an upper pull rod a shock absorber a crank a steering knuckle wheels and a crankshaft and the steering mechanism is in a steering trapezoid shape formed by a connecting rod left and right steering arms and the vehicle bodyThe rolling mechanisms and the steering mechanism share the same vehicle body and linkage is achieved through cross axles and left and right balance levers through vehicle steering and vehicle bodyrolling twodegreeoffreedom movement it is achieved that vehicle steering and vehicle body rolling are separately controlled In the vehicle driving process three working conditions of steering rolling separate rolling and separate steering can be achieved the linkage device is used for active vehicle body rolling during vehicle steering so that when the vehicle turns off or passes througha slope road the vehicle automatically tilts a certain angle to resist centrifugal force or rollover force and a stable driving attitude is kept
