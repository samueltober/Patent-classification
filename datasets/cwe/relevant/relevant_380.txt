 JPA To provide a sealing device which can improve an effect of suppressing intrusion of muddy water to the inside of a bearingSOLUTION A sealing device is used in a wheel rolling bearing device having an inner shaft and an outer ring which are concentrically arranged and including a flange which has a side face opposing an end face of the outer ring in an axial direction with a clearance and is arranged at an end part of the inner shaft The sealing device is arranged at a vehicle outer side of an annular space between the inner shaft and the outer ring and suppresses the intrusion of muddy water into the annular space The sealing device comprises a core grid which is fit and fixed to an end part of the outer ring and a seal member fixed to the core grid and having a deflector arranged at an outside diameter part of the core grid An annular groove part is formed on an external peripheral face of the deflector A wall face at a vehicle inner side out of wall faces of the groove part is an inclination face which inclines so as to separate from the flange as progressing toward the outside in a radial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
