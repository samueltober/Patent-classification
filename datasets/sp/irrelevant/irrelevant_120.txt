 MXA The invention relates to a method for producing a leaf spring  for a vehicle axle suspension wherein the at least one spring arm  bordering on a clamping portion  is formed from a rodshaped preliminary material   by a rolling process By the rolling process for shaping the leaf spring a preliminary material rod   having a rounded crosssectional geometry is rolled out to produce a rectangular crosssectional geometry in the clamping portion  and in the at least one spring arm  and thus the portion of the preliminary material rod   provided for forming the clamping portion  in the finished leaf spring  is also reshaped by the rolling process and as a result a rolled structure is also formed therein
