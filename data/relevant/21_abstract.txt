The invention provides a lowloss modular multilevel converter fault ridethrough method A converter comprises three phase units each unit is divided into an upper bridge arm and a lower bridge armand each bridge arm comprises a plurality of submodules which are connected in series Each submodule consists of two halfbridge structures four capacitors and two flywheel diodes the first halfbridge comprises a first switch module and a second switch module and the second halfbridge comprises a third switch module and a fourth switch module The cathode of the first switch module is connected with the anode of the second switch module the cathode of the second switch module is connected with the anode of the third switch module and the cathode of the third switch module is connected with the anode of the fourth switch module By utilizing the properties of the reverseblocking insulated gate bipolar transistors when a directcurrent side interelectrode shortcircuit fault occurs a twoway switch composed of the reverseblocking insulated gate bipolar transistors is turned off and a fault loop is blocked According to the method the fault blocking of directcurrent side short circuit can be achieved by controlling the onoff of the switch modules and meanwhile loss is not increased
