A flexible switching converter supporting full autonomous control of a microgrid and a control method including a main circuit and a control circuit the main circuit including a power electronic converter and a gridconnected switch connected in parallel and a power electronic converter and a gridconnected switch The two ends are respectively connected to the threephase AC microgrid bus and the grid connection point of the large power grid when the amplitude or phase of the voltage at both ends of the main circuit set between the threephase AC microgrid and the large power grid is different the power electronic converter is used Asynchronous networking realizes the power transmission between the threephase AC microgrid and the large grid when it is necessary to improve the power transmission efficiency adjust the amplitude frequency and phase of the voltage at both ends of the power electronic converter and the gridconnected switch by controlling the power transmission Synchronous soft switching is directly connected to the network through the gridconnected switch The whole process of the invention only needs to control the flexible switching converter which avoids direct realtime control of the distributed power sources in the microgrid thereby supporting the microgrid to realize full autonomous control
