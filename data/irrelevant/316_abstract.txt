Disclosed is a car flat tire safety and stability control method for manned and unmanned vehicles based on vehicle braking driving steering and suspension systems The method establishes flat tire determination by tire pressure detection a state tire pressure and a mechanical steering state and adopts a car tire burst safety and stability control mode model and algorithm and a control structure and procedure Based on a flat tire state point the control over vehicle braking driving and steering a steering wheel gyroscopic force and suspension balancing is executed in a coordinated manner by means of switching between entering and exiting flat tire control and between a normal mode and a flat tire control mode thereby realizing overlapped flat tire control of a real or unreal flat tire process In the case of sharp changes in a flat tire process state a flat tire wheel and a vehicle motion state the technical problems of the severe instability of wheels and a vehicle due to a flat tire the technical difficulties in controlling an extreme flat tire state are resolved and the problem of the car flat tire safety technology is solved
