 CNU The utility model discloses an asymmetric hub bearing locking mechanism The asymmetric hub bearing locking mechanism comprises a locking nut a locking plate and a locking screw an even number of through holes are uniformly and dispersedly formed in the circumference of the end surface of the locking nut and an even number of circular through holes are uniformly and dispersedly formed in the circumference of the end surface of the locking plate after the circular through hole is ignored the locking plate is of a bilaterally symmetrical axisymmetric structure the distribution diameter ofthe circular through holes in the locking plate is the same as that of the through holes in the locking nut the locking screw penetrates through the circular through hole in the locking plate and then is screwed into the threaded through hole of the locking nut an included angle is formed between a connecting line between any two oppositely arranged circular through holes in the locking plate and a symmetric axis of the locking plate after the circular through holes are ignored the included angle enables the locking plate with the circular through hole to be of an asymmetric structure whenone face of the locking plate cannot be aligned and locked with the locking nut the locking plate is directly turned over to be used the probability of occurrence of completely aligned holes can beincreased and therefore the success rate of onetime assembly is increased
