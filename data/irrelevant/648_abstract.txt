According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a power converter apparatus that includes at least two switching bridges connected to a Direct Current DC bus and both generating pulsewidthmodulated PWM voltages to nonisolated outputs and an isolation transformer having a primary winding connected across the outputs of the two switching bridges and a secondary winding connected to isolated outputs In a nonisolated mode the two switching bridges are configured to operate in a parallel mode and power is transferred between the DC bus and the nonisolated outputs In an isolated mode the two switching bridges are configured to operate in a full bridge mode and power is transferred between the DC bus and the isolated outputs through the transformer
