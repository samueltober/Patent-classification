 CNA The invention discloses a diversion type hub bearing unit with a highairtightness and lowtorque sealing structure The diversion type hub bearing unit mainly comprises a sealing ring framework a sealing ring a framework and the like wherein a ring flange is sleeved with an outer ring through rolling friction of a steel ball the sealing ring is arranged in a gap between the outer ring and thering flange for sealing the sealing ring is fixed to an edge of the outer ring through the sealing ring framework the framework is fixed to one side of the ring flange a sealing lip A a sealing lip B and a sealing lip C are arranged on the sealing ring and are matched with the framework to realize sealing and an inlet of the sealing ring is provided with a diversion lip which is matched with the framework to realize a guiding effect on splashed muddy water Through the design of a diversion type sealing structure and the assembly type structural design of the sealing ring and the framework the number of contact lips is reduced the running torque of a hub bearing is reduced effectively meanwhile the sealing performance of a product is improved greatly and the reliability of sealtest is improved No excessive sealing space needs to be added the requirement of a main engine plant for high sealing performance can be met and the requirement for low torque performance can alsobe met
