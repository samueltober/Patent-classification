 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device in which the arrival of muddy water at a seal member along an outer member can be suppressed then the degradation of the sealing performance of the seal member can be suppressedSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  is provided that comprises an outer member  in which outside raceway surfaces c d are formed an inner member  in which inside raceway surfaces c d are formed rolling members   interposed between the raceway surfaces c d and c d of the outer member  and the inner member  and a seal member  sealing an outerside opening end of an annular space S which is formed between the outer member  and the inner member  The wheel bearing device also comprises a mudguard member  fixed to the outer member  The mudguard member  has a block plate part  covering the outer member  and a distal end edge e of the block plate part  extends to a direction in which the distal end edge approximates a flange e for mounting a wheel of a hub ring  constituting the inner member SELECTED DRAWING Figure
