 JPA To improve durability of a rubber elastic body disposed between an inside fitting member to which a piston rod of a shock absorber is fitted and an outside fitting member disposed around thereofSOLUTION A piston rod  of a shock absorber is connected to an inside fitting member  of a strut mount  via a spherical slide member  allowing rotation freedom in any direction thereby controlling vibration or torsion from affecting a rubber elastic body  even when the vibration or torsion occurs in a connection part between the piston rod  and the inside fitting member  of the strut mount SELECTED DRAWING Figure
