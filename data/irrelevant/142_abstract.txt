The invention discloses a centerless optimization method for distributed random nonoverlapping sampling of a multimicrogrid combined virtual power plant which comprises the steps of building a distributed control virtual power plant stratified random optimization model by considering influences of intermittent distributed power supplies analyzing the correlation between each two intermittent distributed power supplies by using a Copula theory and sampling correlation analysis results of the intermittent distributed power supplies by using a distributed random nonoverlapping sampling method so as to convert the virtual power plant stratified random optimization model into a stratified deterministic optimization model to solve According to the method disclosed by the invention the influences of the intermittent distributed power supplied contained by the virtual power plant are considered correlation analysis is performed on the intermittent distributed power supplies by applying the Copula theory and the virtual power plant stratified random optimization model is converted into the stratified deterministic optimization model to solve and empirical distribution estimationis performed on historical data of the intermittent distributed power supply and the prediction precision is improved
