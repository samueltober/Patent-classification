A trilevel converter provides three levels of power supply to a power amplifier that includes a supply path The supply path has a first transistor and a first inherent body diode associated with the first transistor as well as a second transistor and a second inherent body diode associated with the second transistor A polarity of the second body diode is reversed relative to a polarity of the first body diode A first driver is configured to drive the first transistor and the first inherent body diode to control a power supply including a battery supply signal to an output of the trilevel converter The trilevel converter is coupled to a switching node
