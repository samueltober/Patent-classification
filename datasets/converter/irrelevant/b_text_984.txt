 CNA     The invention relates to a method for dynamically constructing resonance characteristics of a highefficiency power converter Part of the resonant element is coupled In the case of dynamic multisource excitation the voltage and phase of multiple energy sourcesvoltage sources are adjusted for one or more power switch units by changing the degree of resonant coupling or equivalent resonance The cavity structure or the number of combined resonant cavities are fitted to the target resonance curve in sections that is different power switch unit control methods are used at different stages to achieve realtime adjustment of the resonant network characteristic curve Compared with the prior art the present invention has the advantages of enabling the system to change the resonance characteristics in different voltage ranges in real time while maintaining the wide voltage range conversion thereby maintaining better gain characteristics and soft switching characteristics
