 JPA To prevent adherence of a hub unit and a wheel due to rusting while suppressing increase in cost of manufactureSOLUTION A wheel bearing in which a pilot part  is integrally provided on any rotatable one of an inner shaft member  and an outer ring member  and a projection  which projects radially outward over the whole circumference in a part of an axial direction is provided on an outer peripheral surface  of the pilot part  The projection  has an apex  which comprises a curve convexed radially outward the apex  is connected to a straight line  and a first continuous point  on one axial direction side and is connected to a straight line  and second continuous point  on the other axial direction side An angle between a tangent line of the apex  and a central axis at the first continuous point  and an angle between a tangent line of the apex  and a central axis at the second continuous point  are respectively  or more and  or less and a center of circle which includes an outermost point P in a radial direction of the apex  the first continuous point  and the second continuous point  exists on a radial direction outer side with respect to the outer peripheral surface SELECTED DRAWING Figure
