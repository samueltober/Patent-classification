 CNB The invention discloses an electronic control suspension and ABS integrated control system A spring of an active suspension system is arranged on the left side of a controlled piston rod in a sleeving mode and a control cylinder is arranged on the right side of the controlled piston rod A sealing block is arranged between the control cylinder and an electromagnet and the control cylinder communicates with a first connecting port of an electromagnetic valve through an oil pipe in a sealing mode A second connecting port of the electromagnetic valve communicates with a brake cylinder of an ABS system in a sealing mode and a third connecting port of the electromagnetic valve communicates with a brake fluid reservoir of the ABS system in a sealing mode The onoff of the electromagnetic valve is controlled by three shuntwound relays and the onoff of control circuits of the three relays are separately controlled by a normal open valve a normallyclosed valve and a hydraulic pump ofthe ABS system When the electromagnetic valve is in a poweroff state the first connecting port and the third connecting port are connected and when the electromagnetic valve is in an energized state the first connecting port and the second connecting port are connected According to the electronic control suspension and ABS integrated control system during the operation of the ABS system the displacement value of the pressing of a headstock of a vehicle and the displacement value of the lifting of the tailstock of a vehicle are prevented from changing with the fluctuation of the braking force and passengers in the vehicle can feel more comfortable
