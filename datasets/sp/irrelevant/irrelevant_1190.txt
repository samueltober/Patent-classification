 CNU The utility model discloses a movable fire extinguishing device for a coal mine Damping wheel the damping wheels are fixedly connected with a damping chassis through supporting legs The top of thedamping chassis is fixedly connected with a bottom plate through damping columns Anticollision fences are fixed to the two ends of the bottom plate a fire extinguishing tank is fixedly installed atthe top of the bottom plate the damping wheels comprise hubs the number of the hubs is  a rubber tire is arranged on the outer ring of each hub a telescopic sleeve is fixedly connected to theinner ring of each hub and the other end of each telescopic sleeve is fixedly connected to the outer side of the corresponding bearing The problem that parts of the fire extinguishing device fall off due to bumping in the mine hole propelling process is solved through the damping wheels bumping force is effectively buffered and meanwhile the phenomenon that the spraying pipe is bent in the fire extinguishing process is effectively avoided through the rotating device
