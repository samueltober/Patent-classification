The invention discloses a method and a device for generating an admittance model of ACDC multiport power equipment The method comprises the steps of carrying out the modeling of a DC side and an AC side based on the fullorder control of an outer ring and an inner ring and the dynamic state of small signals of the inner and outer rings and considering the coupling of an ACDC network and the frequency coupling effect of a converter reflecting the dynamic state of one port at the DC side and the dynamic states of two ports at the AC side in the same admittance model and establishing a threeport threedimensional admittance mode and according to the threeport threedimensional admittance model solving threeport admittance values of the converter gridconnected system under different frequencies and generating a converter threeport admittance model in a frequency band According to the method AC and DC coupling and the frequency coupling effect of the converter are considered at the same time the influence on the AC side and the influence on the admittance of the whole converter during DC side network control or circuit parameter change are visually reflected the accuracy is greatly improved when the method is used for oscillation stability analysis of the system and the universality and the application range are greatly improved
