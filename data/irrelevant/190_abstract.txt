PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a DC power transmission system which detects disconnection of a DC power transmission line and generates a disconnection detection signal and a control deviceSOLUTION A DC power transmission system according to an embodiment comprises a control device that when a first power command value is lower than a prescribed threshold controls a selfexcited power converter by adding a temporally varying monitoring signal to the first power command value and by generating a control signal with use of the resultant value as a second power command value and a disconnection detector that when the first power command value is lower than the prescribed threshold generates a disconnection detection signal indicating occurrence of disconnection of a DC power transmission line on the basis of at least one voltage value of voltages at both ends of the DC power transmission line or the value of a current flowing through the DC power transmission lineSELECTED DRAWING Figure
