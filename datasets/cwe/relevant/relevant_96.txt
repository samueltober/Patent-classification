 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To suppress the lowering of degree of adhesion between an inner ring member and an inner shaft by forming a caulking partSOLUTION A hub unit includes an inner shaft having a small diameter part  on a part of axial direction and an inner ring member fitted to an outer circumferential surface c of the small diameter part  and fixes the inner ring member to the inner shaft by means of a caulking part  which plastically deforms an axially directional end part of the inner shaft to the axially directional outer side Therein on either one side of the outer circumferential surface c of the small diameter part  and an inner circumferential surface of the inner ring member fitted to the outer circumferential surface c at least a swollen surface c which is convexly curved toward the other side of the outer circumferential surface of the small diameter part  and the inner circumferential surface of the inner ring member and is swollen in a state before forming the caulking part  a cylindrical cylinder surface c which is arranged on an axially directional both sides of the swollen surface c and has a constant radius while setting an axial center of the hub unit as a center and a connection surface c which is arranged between the swollen surface c and the cylinder surface c is convexly curved and smoothly connects the swollen surface c and the cylinder surface c are providedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
