 CNA     The invention relates to power converter technology in particular to an ACDC multiport hexagonal modularized multilevel converter and a control method thereof The converter is connected end to end by six bridge arms AF to form a hexagonal ring structure  The six groups of vertices of the ring structure are R W S U T V in clockwise direction and the six bridge arms are respectively connected to two threephase AC ports of which RST constitutes the first port and is connected to the AC power grid  UVW forms the second port which is connected to the wind farm the capacitors on the DC side of each bridge arm Hbridge submodule adopt a bidirectional active bridge which is connected to distributed photovoltaics as a DC port The converter respectively designs and controls the front and rear converters to realize the unified management of power among multiple ports and to ensure the stable operation of the converter It has the characteristics of a high degree of integration and does not require a highvoltage DC bus thereby reducing construction and maintenance costs and reducing energy loss
