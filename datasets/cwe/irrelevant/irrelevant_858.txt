 CNU     The utility model relates to the technical field of electric wheel hubs and provides a wheel hub connected by threads comprising a left half hub and a right half hub the utility model overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art has a reasonable design a compact structure and solves the existing problems The bolted connection  rotates with poor strength and the thicker connector uses poor bolt connection strength and the bolt holes are left on the hub which affects the overall appearance of the hub the utility model can receive  The use effect is good the connection strength is not affected by the thickness of the connecting pieces the connecting pieces are fixed to avoid potential safety hazards and the safety of the threaded hub is improved the use of threaded connection does not require bolt holes on the outer surface of the hub which improves Overall aesthetics by setting the threaded connection movement direction opposite to the wheel hub movement direction the wheel hub will not loose the connection after longterm use which improves the safety of use
