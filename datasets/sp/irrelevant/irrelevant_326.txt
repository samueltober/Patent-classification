 EPB A multilink suspension system particularly suited for the front axle of motor vehicles has a double swing arm hingely mounted on a swivelling pillar a front link a lateral tie rod and a vertical wheel carrier The upper and lower wishbones both arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle are pivotally connected at the outer end with the wheel carrier by means of spherical joints and hingely mounted at the inner end on a bearing pillar which swivels around its central axis inclined with respect to the vertical and which is pivotally connected with the body and subframe of the vehicle by means of a pair of resilient mountings coaxial with it The front link horizontal and angled with respect to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle is pivotally connected with the wheel carrier by means of a spherical joint and with the vehicle subframe by means of a soft resilient bushing which controls the angular travel of the pillar under longitudinal loads induced on the wheel by road irregularities or by braking maneuvers The steering tie rod arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle is pivotally connected with the steering rack and with the wheel carrier by means of spherical joints in order to control the steering angle of the wheel
