A power supply system  includes a front end stage  a boost device  and a power conversion stage  A method includes detecting a voltage across a bulk capacitor of a power supply system wherein the power supply system includes a rectifier a boost device and a power converter and wherein the bulk capacitor is between the boost device and the power converter Between after the voltage across the bulk capacitor decreases and reaches a first voltage threshold the boost device is activated and after the voltage across the bulk capacitor increases and reaches a second voltage threshold it is deactivated In the boost device the second voltage threshold is greater than the first voltage threshold
