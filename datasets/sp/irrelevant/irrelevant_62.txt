 CNB     The invention relates to a wheel suspension having a wheel bracket which can be guided and can be deflected around a steering axis a steering tie rod is operatively connected to the wheel bracket and is oriented in the lateral direction of the vehicle Here the end section of the tie rod close to the wheel carrier is connected via a hinge mechanism to an intermediate element forming a rotation axis which forms a plane inclined with respect to the vehicle vertical axis at the hinge point of the tie rod on the vehicle body side  The tie rod arm is fixed to the intermediate element at a distance from the hinge mechanism the axis of rotation of the intermediate element is inclined in the plane relative to the vertical axis of the vehicle so that the hinge point of the tie rod arm at the intermediate element is in the lateral direction of the vehicle Observe that the center of the vehicle is closer to the vehicles intermediate plane than the intersection of the axis of rotation of the intermediate element and the straight line that extends straight through the hinge point of the tie rod on the vehicle body side and through the hinge mechanism between the tie rod and the intermediate element center
