 CNU The utility model discloses a lateral limiting structure of an air suspension The device comprises a frame and a fixing bolt the side wall of the frame is fixedly connected with a first mounting plate through a fixing bolt the first mounting plate is rotationally connected with a first rotating rod through a bearing the first rotating rod is rotatably connected with a suspension through a bearing in a penetrating manner a plurality of air springs are fixedly connected to the upper wall of the suspension a second mounting plate is welded to the end away from the suspension of each air spring And each second mounting plate is fixedly connected to the side wall of the frame through a bolt a second rotating rod is rotatably connected to the end away from the first rotating rod of the suspension through a bearing in a penetrating mode and a first rotating block is rotatably connected to the second rotating rod through a bearing in a penetrating mode Part of impact can be buffered for the air spring while the air suspension is limited the service life of the air spring is prolonged meanwhile transverse force can be borne a thrust rod is omitted and therefore the bottomspace is more sufficient
