Described is a new partial power converter PPC for the DCDC stage of rapidcharging stations for electric vehicles EV The proposed converter manages only a fraction of the total power delivered from the grid to the battery which increases the general efficiency of the system and the power density while potentially reducing the cost of the charger The proposed topology is based on a switched capacitor between the AC terminals of a bridge converter H and does not require highfrequency isolation transformers in order to provide a source of controllable voltage between the CC link and the battery The proposed concept can be implemented by using interposed power cells which can improve energy quality reduce the size of the inductor and allow scalability for chargers of higher nominal power
