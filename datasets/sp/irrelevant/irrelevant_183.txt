 CNB The invention discloses a vehicle The vehicle comprises a vehicle body and a frame the vehicle further comprises a stable rod the stable rod extends in the vertical direction the two ends of the stable rod are movably connected with the vehicle body separately the middle of the stable rod is rotatably connected with the frame or the two ends of the stable rod are movably connected with the frame separately and the middle of the stable rod is rotatably connected with the vehicle body so that the vehicle body drives the stable rod to turn around and deform when the vehicle body vertically inclines relative to the frame By applying the vehicle when a cab jumps up and down or inclines the stable rod does not turn around and deform and at this moment the stable rod has no effect When braking is conducted the vehicle body inclines forward under the effect of the inertia force and vertically inclines relative to the frame accordingly the stable rod is pulled to turn around anddeform and the torque opposite to the torsion and deformation is generated then the vertical inclining rigidity can be improved the pitching movement of the vehicle body is reduced the situationthat the vehicle body inclines forward excessively due to instant braking so that a driver and a passenger can feel uncomfortable is avoided the comfort of the vehicle is remarkably improved and theuser experience is improved
