 CNU The utility model discloses a steering mechanism a steering wheel assembly and a vehicle The steering mechanism comprises a matched installation structure a driving structure a shock absorber assembly and a bearing assembly A matching bulge part is formed in the middle of the matching mounting structure a mounting groove is formed in the top of the shock absorber base the matching protrusion part is rotatably matched in the mounting groove the connecting column penetrates through the matching protrusion part to be connected with the driving structure and the driving structure drives the shock absorber assembly to rotate The first bearing is arranged between the matching protrusion part and the mounting groove and the second bearing is arranged between the matching protrusion part and the connecting column so that the shock absorber assembly can rotate relative to the matching mounting structure The arrangement position of the steering mechanism is not limited the occupiedarrangement space is smaller the steering mechanism can be arranged on a vehicle body more conveniently the wheels can be driven to independently steer so as to effectively increase the rotating angle of the wheels and therefore the steering driving mode of the wheels is increased and the steering performance of the vehicle is effectively improved
