 EPB One object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a wheel bearing apparatus which can easily and efficiently perform the clearance control of the bearing and stably apply an accurate clearance According to the present invention there is provided a method for manufacturing a wheel bearing apparatus characterized in that the wheel bearing apparatus is manufactured through steps of measuring a distance Ho from a contacting point between one outer raceway surface of the double row outer raceway surfaces of the outer member and one rolling element of the double row rolling elements to a contacting point between the other outer raceway surface of the double row outer raceway surfaces of the outer member and the other rolling element of the double row rolling elements a distance Hi from a contacting point between the rolling element and the inner raceway surface of the inner ring to a smaller end face of the inner ring and a distance Hh from a contacting point between the rolling element and the inner raceway surface of the hub wheel to a shoulder of the hub wheel comparing a difference  H  Hi  Hh  Ho with a reference value of a model article and selecting rolling elements each having an optimum diameter for correcting the difference  H between the measured values and the reference values
