 JPA       The present invention relates to a method for monitoring high voltage direct current transmission In this method a current intensity threshold is set for the current intensity of the high voltage DC transmission at least one interval length is set for the time interval and each set interval length is set over the time interval of the interval length A change threshold is set for the current intensity change of the averaged current intensity The current intensity is detected for each pole of the highvoltage DC power transmission and the current intensity change of the current intensity averaged over the time interval of the interval length is detected for each set interval length If the magnitude of the current intensity of at least one pole is greater than the current intensity threshold or for one interval length the magnitude of the averaged current intensity change of the current intensity of at least one pole is the interval length If it is larger than the set change threshold value it is determined to be a DC failure
