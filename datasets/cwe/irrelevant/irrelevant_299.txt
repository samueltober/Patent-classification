 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of rubber wheels The polishing rubber wheel comprises a rubber wheel body in the prior art stability is not high the problem of inclination or deviation is easy to occur proposed now is the following scheme tire comprising a tyre a hub is fixedly connected to the inner wall of the tire a shaft hole is formed in the middle of the hub the twosides of the shaft hole are obliquely arranged a first taper ring plug and a second taper ring plug are arranged on the two sides of the shaft hole correspondingly threaded grooves are formed in the middle of the first taper ring plug and the middle of the second taper ring plug correspondingly first grooves are formed in the inner walls of the two sides of the second taper ring plug correspondingly and telescopic rods are fixedly connected to the inner walls of the two first grooves correspondingly According to the device the first taper ring plug and the second taper ring plug can beconveniently matched with the inclination angle of the shaft hole the rotating main shaft the first taper ring plug and the second taper ring plug can be conveniently fixed the hub is prevented from deviating due to instability and therefore the stability of the device is improved
