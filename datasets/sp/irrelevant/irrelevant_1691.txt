 CNU The utility model provides air supply equipment for an automobile air suspension The air supply equipment comprises a compression unit and a drying and filtering unit the piston piece is movably installed in the air cavity and divides the air cavity into a firststage compression chamber an air inlet chamber and a secondstage compression chamber the air inlet chamber is communicated with theair inlet pipe the secondstage compression chamber is communicated with the air outlet and an air channel and a first air hole communicated with the air inlet chamber and the firststage compression chamber are formed in the piston piece The piston piece is also provided with a second vent hole for communicating the firststage compression chamber with the air duct and a third vent hole for communicating the secondstage compression chamber with the air duct the connecting rod group is connected with the piston piece and is driven by a motor to drive the piston piece to reciprocate up anddown the filter shell is connected with the compression shell an air outlet of the compression shell is communicated with the filter cavity and the filter element is installed in the filter cavity By adopting a twostage compression technology the highest output gas can reach Bar the pressure of the output gas is high and the adjustment sensitivity of an automobile air suspension systemcan be effectively improved functions are integrated and the total size is smaller
