The invention discloses a marine crane which includes a mechanical structure and a functional control system thereof and converts the lifting and luffing movement limits of the marine crane into the distance between the sliding block and each limit micro switch and is driven by a lead screw In this way the rotating and retracting of the wire rope becomes the translation of the slider on the lead screw There is no need to monitor the boom and hook positions of the marine crane in real time The micro switch in the limit switch box will automatically act to ensure lifting and luffing operations The normal operation of the crane can effectively avoid safety accidents caused by mutual interference when the two operations operate at the same time the function control system can supply and recover energy to the crane The invention also discloses a safe operation method of the marine crane which includes a position definition operation of a variable amplitude limit switch a position definition operation of a lifting limit switch and a multistage variable torsion lifting operation The invention also discloses an energysaving control method of the marine crane
