 USA A threepoint suspension link has a housing supported by a ball joint so as to be rotatably and swivelably movable relative to an axle connection of the link The link further has a captive securing arrangement functioning as a stop and extending perpendicular to the central axis of the axle connection so as to prevent a separation of the housing and axle connection in the event of failure of the ball joint The captive securing arrangement extends perpendicular to the central axis of the axle connection operatively in two spatial directions The threepoint suspension link is formed as an axle guide link for guiding a rigid axle
