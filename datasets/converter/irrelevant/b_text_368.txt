 CNB The invention discloses a multiphase switched reluctance motor current detection method and system The method comprises the steps collecting the total phase currents of other phases on a negative directcurrent bus when a driving control signal of a negative bus switching tube each phase of which is connected to one negative directcurrent bus in an asymmetric halfbridge power converter for separating the negative directcurrent bus is at a low level based on overlapped equivalent front driving control signals calculating each phase current based on all the total phase currents generating negative bus switching tube pulse signals with multiple equal phase differences and collecting the current rotor angle of a motor based on the current rotor angle each phase current and each phase pulse signal generating each phase switch tube driving control signal and controlling the motor and repeating the process to realize current detection of a multiphase switched reluctance motorAccording to the invention only one current sensor is needed and the current of each phase of the multiphase switched reluctance motor is detected through multiphase pulse injection current sampling and phase current solving so the cost of a current detection system is effectively reduced
