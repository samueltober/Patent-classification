 JPA To provide a bearing device for a wheel capable of suppressing vibration in direct advance and also improving a bearing life and a method for manufacturing the bearing device for a wheelSOLUTION A bearing device  for a wheel has an outer ring  with double row outside raceway surfaces c d formed on its inner periphery a hub ring  and an inner ring  respectively having double row inside raceway surfaces c a facing the double row outside raceway surfaces c d on their outer peripheral surfaces and double row ball rows  and  accommodated so as to be rollable between both raceway surfaces of the outer ring  the hub ring  and the inner ring  With at least one of the double row outside raceway surfaces c and d or at least one of the double row inside raceway surfaces c and a attached to a vehicle body without any load a diameter in the direction perpendicular to a direction in which gravity G is applied is larger than a diameter in the direction in which the gravity is appliedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
