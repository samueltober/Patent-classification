The invention relates to a method and a system for accelerating backup protection of a flexible DC distribution network The trip delay time of each circuit breaker in the flexible DC distribution network is preset and the circuit breaker whose first current mutation has a negative polarity is preset The protection is locked When the circuit breaker at one end of the fault line reaches the trip delay time the trip will be performed and the end of the fault line will be disconnected When the polarity of the second current mutation is still positive it can be determined that the fault is located in the positive of the circuit breaker Direction shorten the trip delay time of the circuit breaker at this place and execute the trip action when the fault duration reaches the shortened third trip delay time and disconnect the other end of the fault line Under the condition that the fault current is stably controlled the invention accelerates the tripping of the switch on the other side according to the polarity of the current mutation generated by the switch on one side of the fault line which can greatly shorten the action time of the backup protection and cut off the fault line faster  Improve the protection quick action
