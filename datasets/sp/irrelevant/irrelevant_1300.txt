 CNU The utility model relates to the field of flange design The utility model relates to a flange in particular to a novel integrated flange Including a body first mounting through holes are formed inthe body and first fixing through holes are formed around the end faces of the first mounting through holes at intervals The hub bearing is inserted into the first mounting through hole and the second fixing through hole and the first fixing through hole in the periphery of the hub bearing are fixed through a first bolt two third fixing through holes are formed in the edge close to the firstfixing through hole of the body the wheel brake is fixed at the third fixing through hole through a second bolt a boss and a groove for inserting the end part of the cross beam are arranged on theinner side surface of the body counterbores are formed in the outer end faces of the bosses The hub bearing the wheel brake and the shock absorber can be installed together in a centralized mode through one body the structure is compact detachable fixing is achieved through the first bolt the second bolt and the screw the risk that a rear torsion beam fails due to failure of a weld joint is avoided and the safety coefficient is high in use
