 CNB     A wheel bearing device is provided in which the sealing performance of a seal is enhanced without increasing the sealing torque and the bearing life is increased The seal  is provided with a metal core  which is pressfitted into the inner periphery at the end of the outer member  and a first side lip a which is coupled to the metal core  and faces in a radial direction The outer side is formed obliquely so that it faces the metal ring  across the axial direction gap and the metal ring  is fitted to the base  of the wheel attachment flange  And the third side lip a slides in a radial direction from the base  covering the outer edge of the metal core  toward the outer surface of the wheel attachment flange  Formed obliquely outside The end portion of the third side lip a is formed flat and faces the side surface b of the wheel attachment flange  through an axial gap thereby constructing a first labyrinth seal  and the metal ring The outer edge of  faces the sealing member  through the axial gap thereby constructing a labyrinth seal
