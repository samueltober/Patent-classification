The invention discloses a power electronic transformer system fault reconstruction method and belongs to the technical field of power electronics The middle protection switch is formed by connectingthree switch groups which are opened and closed at the same time with an upper output port a clamping midpoint and a lower output port of the cascade rectifier in series respectively when a power electronic transformer operates normally the intermediate protection switch is in a closed state and a DCDC converter is in a putin state when the directcurrent link of the power electronic transformer fails the intermediate protection switch is quickly switched off the method specifically comprises the following steps carrying out carrier stacking calculation to generate a level k and judging an area R where a modulation wave u is located according to k and R establishing a switching state equation of an n submodule cascade rectifier and establishing a first switching state table and acquiring and sorting the DC output voltage of each submodule performing smooth optimization processing on the obtained switching state establishing a second switching state table and matching the switching state in the second switching state table to each submodule so that the reconstruction of the DC link fault is completed
