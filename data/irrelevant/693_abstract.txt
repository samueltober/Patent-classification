A wiring structure of a cascaded highvoltage frequency converter power unit radiator relates to the technical field of highvoltage frequency converter power units solves the problems that a highvoltage frequency converter is large in size and high in radiator requirement and comprises a packaged power unit shell and a radiator and the packaged power unit shell comprises two power units Theradiator is connected with the power unit and is respectively connected with the positive bus of one power unit and the negative bus of the other power unit through highvoltage resistors the voltagechange rate of the radiator is reduced and the electromagnetic interference to other circuits is reduced
