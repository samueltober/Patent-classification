 JPB To simultaneously reduce a leakage current in a load connected with a multilevel inverter circuit at a main unit side and a leakage current in a load connected with an inverter circuit at an auxiliary unit sideSOLUTION A power converter comprises a converter circuit  for generating an intermediate voltage a multilevel inverter circuit  controlled at three levels an inverter circuit  driven at the intermediate voltage and a controller  for controlling an AC voltage output of the multilevel inverter circuit  and the inverter circuit  and controlling the intermediate voltage according to required voltage of the load connected with the inverter circuit  The intermediate voltage controlled by a total voltage of a command voltage of a load connected with the inverter circuit  and a drop voltage of the inverter circuit  suppresses a voltage change rate of the multilevel inverter circuit  and the number of switching to suppress the leakage current Then the inverter circuit  is driven at a low voltage allowing the load connected with the inverter circuit  to suppress the leakage current simultaneouslySELECTED DRAWING Figure
