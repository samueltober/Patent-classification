 CNA In a vehicle suspension assembly  a sensor system  is applied to a wheel hub unit in which a radially outer cylindrical surface  of an outer ring  of the wheel hub unit configured for coupling to a suspension column or knuckle  has four circumferential flat portions  angularly spaced from each other on the radially outer cylindrical surface each flat portion delimits axially extending flat surfaces  on a pair of annular tracks  of the outer ring for rolling bodies  each flat portion integrally carries a sensor module  comprising a pair of extensometers  positioned parallel to each other and each oriented in a circumferential direction at a location of a respective annular track to extend along a circumferential extension of the annular track circuitry  acquires signals from each sensor module and sends them to a data socket carried by the suspension column or knuckle
