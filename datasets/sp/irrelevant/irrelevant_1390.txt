 CNA The invention provides a commercial vehicle lightweight air suspension lifting device and method and a vehicle The commercial vehicle lightweight air suspension lifting device comprises a vehicle frame and a rear air cylinder a lifting axle and a rear air bag are connected to a part close to the tail of the vehicle frame the lifting axle is connected with the frame through a rear swing arm anda rear support and the rear swing arm can rotate around the center of the rear support a drive axle is arranged close to the front part of the frame bearing air bags are symmetrically arranged onthe two sides of the drive axle and a tail beam is arranged at the tail part of the frame and is used for supporting the air suspension The bearing air bags on the two sides of the lifting bridge have the bearing and lifting effects at the same time and compared with the technical state that smallcapacity lifting air bags are additionally arranged the number of the air bags is reduced valvesand control pipelines attached to the additionallyarranged air bags are reduced the overall reliability of the suspension can be improved and later maintenance cost can be reduced compared with the technical state of replacing the middle air bag by removing the bearing air bag the bearing capacity of the doubleside air bags is higher the limited arrangement space is saved and the drivingstability under the heavyload working condition is better
