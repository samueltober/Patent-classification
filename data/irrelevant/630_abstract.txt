Inverters that interface dc and ac power sources and loads are provided An example application is solar power systems in which a dc source of power is an array of solar panels the inverter converts the dc power supplied by these panels to ac power that is fed into the utility grid Another example is battery energy storage the inverter changes the dc power of the batteries into ac power that is fed into the grid and also can convert rectify ac power from the grid for charging the batteries In one embodiment for example an inverter comprises slow switches that generate a threelevel ac voltage followed by a plurality of fastswitching halfbridges that introduce highfrequency pulsewidth modulation into a plurality of ac output voltages
