 CNA     The embodiment of the present invention relates to a multiphase fan DC gridconnected system and a lowvoltage ridethrough control method thereof The method controls the operation of the switching element of the isolation conversion module through a first trigger pulse signal and controls the halfbridge module by using a second trigger pulse signal The operation of the switching element enables the DC gridconnected system of the multiphase fan to achieve lowvoltage ridethrough DC gridconnected The lowvoltage ridethrough control method of the multiphase wind turbine DC gridconnected system realizes the maximum power tracking of the generator motor side through the outer loop control of the speed of the generator motor and realizes by collecting the average value of the capacitor voltage of the halfbridge submodule in the halfbridge module when a fault occurs DC gridconnected lowvoltage ridethrough control does not require auxiliary equipment to achieve lowvoltage ridethrough It also improves the stability of the multiphase fan DC gridconnected system and solves the existing multiphase fan DC gridconnected system using threephase fan DC gridconnected need assistance The equipment realizes low voltage ridethrough and increases the technical problems caused by the construction of the multiphase wind turbine DC gridconnected system
