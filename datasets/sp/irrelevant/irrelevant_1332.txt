 JPA To provide a vehicular suspension device with high practicability in which a stroke ratio a ratio of a shock absorber stroke amount to a wheel stroke amount can be made comparatively largeSOLUTION The vehicular suspension device is configured to comprise a a carrier  that rotatably holds a wheel  b a lower arm  and an upper arm  whose one end parts are turnably supported on a vehicle body  and whose other end parts are connected to the carrier  c an oscillatable lever  whose one end part is oscillatably supported on the vehicle body  d a link  whose one end part is connected to the oscillatable lever  and whose other end part is connected to an either of the lower amr  and the upper arm  at a place between the one end part and the other end part of the either e and a shock absorber  whose one end part is turnably supported on the vehicle body  and whose other end part is connected to the oscillatable lever SELECTED DRAWING Figure
