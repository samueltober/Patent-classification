 KRB     The present invention relates to an axle assembly in which wheel speed measurement is made precise and a knuckle having a bearing latch formed at a position adjacent to the vehicle among an inner circumferential surface so that the bearing can be inserted from the outside to the inside of the vehicle and a speed sensor provided on the locking jaw Wow it includes a magnetic encoder provided in the bearing and since the vehicles wheel rotation speed measurement using a magnetic encoder becomes more accurate than the current level the wheel speed measurement which has the effect of measuring a more accurate wheel rotation speed becomes more precise Provide axle assembly
