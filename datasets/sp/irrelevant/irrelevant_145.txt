 CNB     The invention discloses a control method of an electromagnetic hybrid suspension The electromagnetic hybrid suspension is divided into four modes comfort mode sports mode comprehensive mode and energy feeding mode The switching between the four modes is determined by the driver In the comfort sports and comprehensive modes hybrid control is used which is divided into two submodes active control mode and semiactive control mode The switching condition between the two submodes is to introduce a new parameter Cact And the maximum equivalent electromagnetic damping coefficient C of the linear motoreqmaxComparative judgment The invention solves the problem of coordination between suspension comfort and tire grounding performance and the mode switching is determined by man to meet the needs of different working conditions and different users At the same time the hybrid control method solves the problems of high energy consumption of the active suspension and limited control effect of the semiactive suspension It can reduce energy consumption while ensuring the dynamic performance of the vehicle suspension At the same time the design of the energy feeding mode enables the suspension to recover energy which meets the requirements of energy saving and emission reduction
