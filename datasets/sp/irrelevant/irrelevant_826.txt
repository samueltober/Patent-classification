 CNA The invention discloses a nonindependent suspension system which comprises two sets of suspension structures and a middle supporting piece the two sets of suspension structures are connected throughthe middle supporting piece and the supporting end of each set of suspension structure is installed on a rack Each suspension structure comprises an elastic element and at least one guide mechanism and vertical telescopic movement is achieved through the guide mechanisms A swing bearing is installed at the joint of each guide mechanism and the middle supporting piece Each suspension structure is provided with a prepressing structure which provides initial pressure for the elastic element of the suspension structure and can pretighten the elastic element and adjust the initial height ofthe suspension system After loading the elastic elements compress a certain amount and a driving wheel can jump upwards and downwards in the moving process to adapt to ground unevenness and crossobstacles Thus lowbottom equipment such as a saloon car and a tool car can be directly submerged According to the nonindependent suspension system the guide shafts of the guide mechanisms are allowed to have a certain swing angle and are limited to swing in one direction and effective contact between the driving wheel and the ground can be guaranteed
