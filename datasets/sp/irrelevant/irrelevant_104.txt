 DEB     Device  for a pendulum support for torque decoupling and transmission of an axial force from a first component to a second component comprising a first socket  for at least indirect connection to the first component and a second socket  for at least indirect connection with the second component at least two axial bearing elements   being spatially arranged between the two bushes   for the rotatable mounting of the two bushes  wherein the first bush  can be acted upon with a torque and an axial force and wherein the second bush  absorbs the axial force essentially without torque with a respective axial disk   axially between the first bush  and the respective axial bearing element   wherein at least one spring element  is arranged axially between the first bushing  and a respective axial washer   in order to secure the at least two axial bearing elements   axially preloading with a connecting element  for connecting the first component to the first bushing  being arranged axially on the first bushing  characterized in that the second bushing  has at least one radial expression   on which the at least two axial bearing elements   come to bear axially
