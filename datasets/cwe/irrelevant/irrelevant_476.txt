 WOA Provided is a bearing device for a wheel which has improved axial assembly accuracy of a sealing member by reducing the amount of springback The bearing device  for a wheel comprises an inner sealing member  that blocks an inner opening end of an annular space S formed by an outer ring  and an inner ring  A sealing ring  of the inner sealing member  has a core metal  fitting in the outer ring  and an elastic member  joined to the core metal  The elastic member  has a pressing part  that is pressed inward in the axial direction when the sealing ring  is pressfitted into the outer ring  and a nonpressing part  that is not pressed inward in the axial direction when the sealing ring  is pressfitted into the outer ring  wherein the axial thickness T of the pressing part  is thinner than the axial thickness T of the nonpressing part
