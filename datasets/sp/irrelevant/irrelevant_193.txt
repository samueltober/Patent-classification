 CNB An independent suspension mechanism for an omnidirectional mobile platform includes two symmetrically arranged mecanum wheels driving devices are connected to the inner sides of the mecanum wheelsand damping mechanisms are connected to mounting brackets at the outer sides of the mecanum wheels spring guide rods are arranged at both sides of reduction gears the top portions of the spring guide rods are connected with a car body mounting plate and the bottom portions of the spring guide rods are connected with the mounting brackets and the middle of the spring guide rods are sleeved withfirst rectangular crosssection springs and a closed structure is formed by the two mecanum wheels through the car body mounting plate the mounting brackets and a connecting plate According to the independent suspension mechanism for the omnidirectional mobile platform the pressure can be adjusted according to the load and ground conditions under multiple different environmental conditionsthe influence of the ground on the running process of the mecanum wheels can be reduced and the phenomenon of suspension of a certain group of wheels due to the unevenness of the ground is avoidedand the independent suspension mechanism for the omnidirectional mobile platform has the advantages of stable operation of the platform strong ability to overcome obstacles and high bearing capacity
