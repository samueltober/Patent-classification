 CNU The utility model relates to a novel steel plate spring guide arm assembly Onepiece half structure the second piece is a long piece front and rear end rolled lugs a guiding effect is mainly achieved and a small part of load and all transverse force are borne the first piece is a half piece and is arranged above the second piece the front end of the first piece is of a reverse lug structureand plays a role in protecting the second piece the rear end of the first piece is connected with the bearing air spring assembly and plays a role in bearing the whole steel plate spring guide armassembly is longitudinally arranged and the front end and the rear end are hinged to a fixed steel plate spring support and a movable lifting lug on a frame respectively to achieve bearing and guiding effects By means of the structural design of the semisteelplate spring guide arm the problem that when a singleleafspring guide arm is broken driving safety of a whole vehicle cannot be guaranteed is solved other bearing elements are installed on the rear side of the front axle the height of a wheel center is effectively reduced and Sshaped deformation of a steel plate spring during braking is resisted
