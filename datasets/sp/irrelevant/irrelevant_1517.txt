 CNA The invention belongs to the technical field of robot equipment and particularly relates to an omnidirectional movement robot which comprises a chassis frame and an even number of suspension drivingsystems each suspension driving system comprises a fixing base a power output assembly a steering support assembly and a damping device and the whole robot is driven by the suspension driving systems to move and walk The damping effect in the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction is achieved in the moving and walking process through a damping device of the suspension driving system the power output assembly outputs power to the steering support assembly and the omnidirectional moving robot rotates by any angle and direction in the moving and walking process so as to achieve the moving and walking steering function All the suspension driving systems independently achieve the driving walking function and the vibration reduction function and therefore the omnidirectional movement robot has better obstacle crossing capacity In conclusion by applying the technical scheme the problems that a chassis system of an existing robot is poor in vibration reduction capacity and obstacle crossing capacity are solved
