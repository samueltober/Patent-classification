 USA A Modular Multilevel Converter MMC circuit for converting DC power to AC and vice versa At each respective connection to the AC powersourceload the MMC circuit uses one Pulse Width Modulation Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor PWM IGBT to control the switching between upper and lower arms of submodules The circuit eliminates the interphase inductors often used in MMCs and replaces the inductors by two complementarygated PWM IGBTs thereby eliminating circulating current Moreover the multilevel converter topology disclosed herein requires less number of components including PWM IGBTs and capacitors In fact at least two submodules perphase are eliminated one submodule in the upper arm and one submodule in the lower arm In other words the MMC topology not only mitigates the circulating current but also eliminates at least one submodule in the upper arm and at least one submodule in the lower arm perphase
