The invention discloses a highreliability doubleinput sevenlevel static converter and belongs to the technical field of power electronic converters The converter is composed of two directcurrentvoltage sources VinVin ten switching tubes SS eight diodes DD two buffer inductors LL a filter inductor Lo a filter capacitor Co and a load Zo According to the invention different combinations of two direct current voltage sources are fully utilized to obtain seven bridge arm voltages acting on the two ends of an output filter so that the voltage stress of a power tube is reduced and the electromagnetic interference caused by dvdt is reduced meanwhile the inverter has the advantages of high integration level no body diode freewheeling problem no straightthrough risk and the like of a doubleinput doublebuck type inverter the quasiconstant frequency hysteresis current control strategy is adopted harmonic waves are easy to filter and the designdifficulty of the filter is reduced The converter is particularly suitable for highreliability highpower application occasions such as aerospace
