A system and method of transmitting power according to some embodiments includes sequentially pinging each of a plurality of transmit coils to locate a receiver determining one or more active coils from the plurality of transmit coils based on the location of the receiver activating the one or more active coils in a fullbridge mode to transfer power to the receiver determining a base efficiency based on the one or more active coils monitoring nonactive ones of the plurality of transmit coils determining if the receiver has moved based on the monitoring if the receiver has moved to a new position determining secondary coils according to the new position and transitioning power to provide power from a new active coil configuration
