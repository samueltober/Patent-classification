 USA The present invention relates to a support damping apparatus and a vehicle using the support damping apparatus The support damping apparatus includes a support spring a force measuring element and a damper The damper includes a hydraulic cylinder a valve assembly and a control assembly The force measuring element measures a support force value of the support damping apparatus for a supported object and compares the support force value with a target force value The damping force value of the damper is controlled by the control assembly in a mechanical hydraulic or electric manner according to a comparison result so as to adjust the support force value of the support damping apparatus so that the support force value of the support damping apparatus is equal to or approximate to the target force value The present invention also relates to a vehicle with the support damping apparatus
