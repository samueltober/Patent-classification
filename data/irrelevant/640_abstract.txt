The invention provides a poweroff control system The poweroff control system comprises a backup power supply a poweroff control module a power supply conversion module and an energy storage andrelease module The backup power supply is used for supplying power to the power supply conversion module and the poweroff control module when an external power supply is disconnected the poweroffcontrol module is used for controlling the power supply conversion module to be turned on and controlling the energy storage release module to be turned off when the output voltage of the backup powersupply is higher than a threshold value and controlling the power supply conversion module to be turned off and controlling the energy storage release module to be turned on when the output voltageof the backup power supply is lower than the threshold value the power supply conversion module is used for providing working voltage for an external load when being started and the stored energy release module is used for releasing the stored energy of the backup power supply when the power supply conversion module is turned off The problem that in the prior art the output voltage of a backupbattery oscillates and a power supply conversion module is prone to damage is solved
