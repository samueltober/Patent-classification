 CNU The utility model relates to a front axle assembly with shock absorbers assisting in absorbing side impact energy which comprises a front axle a front cross beam and two longitudinal bumpers two ends of the front cross beam are supported at two ends of the front axle through the shock absorbers the two longitudinal bumpers are distributed on two sides of the front cross beam in the length direction and the longitudinal bumpers are connected with the front cross beam through front axle side impact energy dissipation devices The automobile side collision energy absorption device has the advantages that side collision energy can be absorbed without crumpling deformation of an automobile frame during side collision the shock absorber supporting the automobile frame participates in energy absorption and the problem of poor safety caused by the fact that an existing automobile needs crumpling energy absorption of an automobile body during side collision is solved
