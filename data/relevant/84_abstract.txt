This application provides a converter valve highpressure operation circuit an onsite test system and a control method The operating circuit includes two converter chains one or two cascaded energy supply chains the two converter chains respectively include N submodules and M submodules the cascaded energy supply chain includes at least N or At least M diode units the submodules include DC capacitors and power units connected in parallel the AC terminals of the submodules are connected in series the AC terminals of the first terminal module and the last terminal module are led out as the AC terminals of the converter chain and two converters One AC end of the chain is connected via the connecting reactor and the other AC end is shortcircuited the diode units are connected in series in the same direction the cathode end of the cascaded energy supply chain is connected to the anode end of the DC capacitor of the tail terminal module and the anode ends of all diode units It corresponds to the positive pole of the DC capacitor of the submodule of the converter chain in a onetoone correspondence or is connected through the first current limiter
