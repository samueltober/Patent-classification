 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of robots in particular to an AGV intelligent mobile chassis and aims to solve the problems that existing movable robots tend to carry too many deviceswhen a lower layer serves as a walking chassis the gravity center of the robot is high the chassis is unstable many robot chassis are unreasonable in internal arrangement the size increased and maintenance is inconvenient A disc body is provided with four driven wheels a driving wheel is directly connected with a motor in the middle of the disc body a motor bracket is fixed to a swing armthe swing arm is fixed on a bearing seat and the bearing seat is fixed in the upper side of the disc body The design structure is simple assembly is convenient a driving module and the driven wheels are all fixed on the chassis the gravity center of the mobile chassis is lowered a laser radar an ultrasonic sensor and a power control panel are compactly arranged arrangement is more reasonable disassembly assembly and repair are convenient and particularly for the inspection robot with more mounting equipment and larger weight the inspection robot can walk more stably due to designof the lowgravitycenter movable chassis
