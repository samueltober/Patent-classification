The invention discloses a hybrid twoend directcurrent power transmission system and an external characteristic test method thereof On one hand for the LCC the corresponding electrical quantity ofa power grid commutation converter is observed in real time by adopting a mode of keeping the capacitor voltage of a modular multilevel converter to gradually increase or decrease the direct currentvoltage reference value of the modular multilevel converter and on the other hand aiming at the MMC a mode of gradually increasing or decreasing a trigger angle reference value of the power grid commutation converter and observing a corresponding signal of the modular multilevel converter in real time is adopted to complete the test of the external characteristics of the hybrid twoend directcurrent power transmission system The technical problem that in the prior art the external characteristics of the hybrid twoend directcurrent power transmission system with one end adopting the LCCand the other end adopting the MMC are difficult to test is solved
