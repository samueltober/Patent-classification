 JPA To provide a DC transmission system in which current excessively larger than rated current is inhibited from flowing even when a ground faultshortcircuit accident occurs in a DC transmission lineSOLUTION A transmissionside power converter  includes a modular multilevel converter and has an AC side for receiving an output from a power generation device  and has a DC side connected to a DC transmission line  A receptionside power converter  has a DC side connected to the DC transmission line  and has an AC side connected to an AC system  A current limiter  is provided between the power generation device  and the transmissionside power converter  and imposes a limitation to prevent the current flowing through the transmissionside power converter  from exceeding an upper limit value When a DC accident occurs a cell constituting the modular multilevel converter of the transmissionside power converter  generates zero voltageSELECTED DRAWING Figure
