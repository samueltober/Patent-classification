 JPB To provide a radio frequency power generator and a control method capable of addressing arc events or other energy discontinuities in a plasma loadSOLUTION A radio frequency power generator  includes a signal generator  a power amplifier  at least one sampler  configured to sample an output signal of the power amplifier  and a controller  comprising a digital control portion and an analogue control portion One or both of the digital control portion and the analogue control portion are configured to control at least the power amplifier  andor the signal generator  An analogue feedback path between the at least one sampler  and the controller  enables an analogue signal representation of a signal from the at least one sampler  to be provided to the controller  and a digital feedback path between the at least one sampler  and the controller  enables a digital signal representation of a signal from the at least one sampler  to be provided to the controller SELECTED DRAWING Figure
