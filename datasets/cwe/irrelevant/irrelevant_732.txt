 CNU According to the technical scheme the longservicelife hub bearing is characterized in that the longservicelife hub bearing comprises a connecting flange the connecting flange comprises a connecting disc and a mounting barrel a bearing body is arranged in the mounting barrel and comprises an outer ring and a plurality of connecting grooves are formed in the peripheral wall of the outer ring in the axial direction the multiple connecting grooves are distributed in an annular array mode in the circumferential direction of the outer ring cooling fins are detachably connected to the interiors of the connecting grooves the mounting cylinder is provided with a mounting groove used for clamping the outer ring and the outer circumferential wall of the mounting cylinder is provided with multiple cooling grooves communicated with the mounting groove The radiator has the advantages that the connecting grooves are formed in the peripheral wall of the outer ring the radiating fins are detachably connected in the connecting grooves and the radiating grooves are formed in the positions corresponding to the radiating fins of the peripheral wall of the mounting cylinder so that heat exchange can be conducted in the radiating grooves and therefore heat generated by the outer ring can be rapidly radiated the abrasion among the steel balls the inner ring and the outer ring is not easy to intensify so that the service life of the whole bearing main body is prolonged
