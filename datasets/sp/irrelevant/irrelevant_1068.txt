 CNU The utility model discloses a shock absorption structure of a doublewheel differential AGV chassis which comprises a shock absorption mounting plate driving wheel mounting grooves are formed in thetwo sides of the middle of the top end of a bearing fixing plate a shock absorption mounting plate is arranged in each of the two driving wheel mounting grooves and a motor mounting plate is arranged at the bottom of each of the two shock absorption mounting plates According to the utility model the structure is simple when the bearing fixing plate passes through an uneven road surface through the elastic effect of a first cushioning spring between the damping mounting plate and the motor mounting plate the rotating bracket rotates on the connecting frame to drive the motor mounting plate to rotate downwards or upwards the driving wheel is attached to the road surface meanwhile the second cushioning springs enable the damping mounting frame and the damping universal wheels to beattached to the road surface in the process due to the limiting effect of the positioning grooves and the positioning bolts inclination and deviation of the damping mounting frame are avoided andtherefore the situation that the AGV chassis deforms due to instability or heavy loads in the running process of the AGV is avoided
