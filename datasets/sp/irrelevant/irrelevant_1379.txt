 CNA The invention discloses a hydraulic buffer for an automobile The hydraulic buffer for the automobile comprises a pipe body a piston a piston rod a spring a bearing an oil inlet cavity and an oilreturn cavity The pipe body is internally provided with a damping unit The damping unit comprises a base fixedly arranged in the pipe body the base is fixedly provided with a sleeve body and thesleeve body is internally provided with an extension sleeve in dynamic seal with the piston A core body is embedded in the sleeve body and the core body has a degree of freedom of axial movement along the pipe body relative to the sleeve body By means of the hydraulic buffer for the automobile the shock absorption effect of the buffer is improved the impact force generated when the spring moves back and forth is lowered and the comfort is improved and meanwhile through the design of the damping unit structure flowing of oil is buffered flowing of the oil is more stable then the damping stability is improved and vibration caused by unstable flowing of the oil is lowered
