 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a wheel bearing device with rotation speed detection device which easily discharges a foreign substance to the outside even if the foreign substance is intruded into a cover prevents the foreign substance from being immersed into a bearing prevents a flaw or abrasion from being generated by meshing the foreign substance into a detection part and improves reliabilitySOLUTION A cover  comprises a cylindrical fitting part a which is externally fitted to an end portion of an external member  a flange part b which extends radially insides from the fitting part a and is adhered to an end face of the external member  and a bottom part d which extends radially insides from the flange part b and includes a circular hole  to which a shoulder part  of an outside joint member  is fitted A pair of drains  are formed in a direction of the bottom part d vertical to a road surface and an inner diameter of the circular hole  is set to a larger diameter than a fitting surface of an inner wheel  and a magnetic encoder  Thus even if a foreign substance intruded into the cover  and is stagnated slurry or the like can be prevented from being immersed into the bearingSELECTED DRAWING Figure
