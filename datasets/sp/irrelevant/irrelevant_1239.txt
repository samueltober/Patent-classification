 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of air suspension systems The utility model relates to a steering knuckle mechanism in particular to a steering knuckle mechanism for an independentair suspension system with a needle bearing The defects in the prior art are overcome the device comprises a steering knuckle a needle roller bearing and a sealing pressing ring a first mounting hole and a second mounting hole are respectively formed in the steering knuckle a copper bush is assembled in the first mounting hole a first inclined surface and a second inclined surface are respectively arranged on two sides of the bottom wall of the second mounting hole a copper bush at the lower end of a traditional knuckle assembly is changed into the needle roller bearing through reasonable size change The friction force between mechanisms is greatly reduced abrasion of a vehicle in the running process can be effectively reduced the steering aligning capacity of the whole vehicle is improved the needle roller bearing is installed in a pressed mode through the sealing pressing ring the structure is simple the sealing performance is high the overall service life of equipmentcan be effectively prolonged and the installation precision of the needle roller bearing is improved through positioning installation of the matched conical surface and inclined surface
