 CNU A crane damping wheel set relates to the technical field of crane wheel damping and comprises a bearing box a positioning support plate a pressing plate and a damping spring A chassis of the craneis provided with two positioning supporting plates wheels are located between the two positioning supporting plates and the plate faces of the positioning supporting plates correspond to the outer edge faces of the wheels The two ends of the wheel axle are each provided with a bearing box the two bearing boxes are located on the two sides of the wheel pressing plates are arranged between thebearing boxes and the two positioning supporting plates one sides of the pressing plates are fixedly connected with the two bearing boxes correspondingly and the other sides of the pressing plates are slidably connected with the corresponding positioning supporting plates Counter bores are vertically formed in the ends close to the bearing box of the top faces of the pressing plates respectively one ends of guide rods are inserted into smalldiameter holes of the counter bores largediameter holes of the counter bores are correspondingly clamped with one ends of damping springs the other ends of the damping springs are correspondingly connected with the chassis through fixing bases and through holes correspondingly matched with the guide rods are formed in the fixing bases The device is simple in structure and has a good damping effect
