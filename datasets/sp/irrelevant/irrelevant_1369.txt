 CNA The invention relates to a technical device and an application method of a vehicle inertia force buffer adjustment controller which are technically characterized in that a novel split type wheel is specially manufactured and multifunctional integration of the wheel is realized to form a set of device of the vehicle inertia force buffer adjustment controller Realtime adjustment and control canbe performed according to the change of inertia force and effective adjustment and comprehensive management and control of the inertia force of the vehicle are implemented by exerting corresponding effects of all parts of the buffer adjustment control device The transmission ratio is reduced by a variablespeed regulator device and an axle transmission gear is separated from the wheel by a clutch device to realize differentspeed operation of axles And meanwhile a transmission shaft meshing gear is connected with a planetary gear set and is controlled by the motor to implement buffer braking to accurately apply acting force The connecting rod support assembly of a hydraulic damper bears inertia force buffering of the vehicle a set of Xshaped buffering support is adopted at the connecting position of a bearing support a hydraulic sliding groove linear gear transmission structure is matched and inertia force in the frontback direction of the vehicle is converted into hydraulicbuffering force in the updown direction
