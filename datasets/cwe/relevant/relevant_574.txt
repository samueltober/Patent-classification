 JPA To provide a preload inspection method with which a preload value can be calculated more accurately and to provide a preload inspection method with which it can be more accurately determined whether or not a preload state is acceptableSOLUTION The preload inspection method is for a wheel bearing device  comprising an outer member  having doublerow outside raceway surfaces c d an inner member  having doublerow inside raceway surfaces c d and consisting of a hub wheel  and an inner wheel  pressed into a small diameter step part a of the hub wheel  and doublerow rolling bodies   respectively interposed between the raceway surfaces c d of the outer member  and the raceway surfaces c d of the inner member  The method comprises a power calculation step S in which the outer member  or the inner member  is rotated in a relative manner to calculate power P a preload value calculation step S in which a preload value F is calculated on the basis of the power P calculated in the power calculation step S and a passfail determination step S in which passfail determination is made on the basis of whether or not the preload value F calculated in the preload value calculation step S falls within an allowable range RSELECTED DRAWING Figure
