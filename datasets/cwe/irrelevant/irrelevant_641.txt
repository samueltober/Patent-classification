 CNU The utility model relates to a sealing device for a hub bearing which comprises an outer ring rigid framework an inner ring rigid framework a rubber layer and a PTFE Polytetrafluoroethylene sheet the outer ring rigid framework is fixedly connected with the rubber layer the end part of the rubber layer is fixedly connected with the PTFE sheet and the PTFE sheet is propped against the inner ring rigid framework and is in sliding fit with the inner ring rigid framework Through the structural form the sealing effect is guaranteed meanwhile sealing performance failure caused by contact abrasion of rubber in traditional sealing is avoided and therefore the sealing performance is improved meanwhile the energy consumption is reduced The hub bearing comprises a bearing outer ring a bearing inner ring balls and a retainer the sealing device for the hub bearing is arranged between the bearing inner ring and the bearing outer ring the outer ring rigid framework is fixedly embedded in the bearing outer ring and the bearing inner ring is fixedly sleeved with the inner ring rigid framework The sealing device for the hub bearing is installed on the hub bearing the hub bearing avoids sealing failure caused by rubber abrasion and the sealing performance is improved meanwhile the energy consumption is reduced
