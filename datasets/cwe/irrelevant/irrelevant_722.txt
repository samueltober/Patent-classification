 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device which can enhance a coupling force between a steelmade portion and a resinmade portion contained in an outer ringSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  comprises an inner shaft member  attached with wheels  an outer ring  fixed to a knuckle  and a plurality of balls  The outer ring  has a cylindrical main body  in which a raceway surface with which the balls  rollingly contact is formed at an internal peripheral side and a plurality of fixing flanges  which is separated from each other in a peripheral direction arranged while extending to the outside in a radial direction from the main body  and fixed to the knuckle  The fixing flanges  have steelmade flange parts  and resinmade flange parts  for covering the steelmade flange parts  The steelmade flange parts  have salient parts  which are formed along external peripheries of the steelmade flange parts  The resinmade flange parts  have resinmade covering parts  for covering the salient parts  from the outside in a radial direction and both sides in an axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
