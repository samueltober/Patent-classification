 CNU The utility model discloses an offroad vehicle mutual supporting type free axle chassis which is characterized in that supporting springs are in mutual force transmission connection two tires on thetwo sides of each side of a rectangular vehicle frame equally support the weight of the side a front antitilting rod and a rear antitilting rod are in interactive connection and the leftright tilting value of the vehicle frame is made to be equal to the middle value of two tilting values of a front doublewheel and a rear doublewheel The front antitipping rod is in interactive connectionwith the steering gear and the toughness of the outer side of the bend is enhanced and weakened through the change of the steering pull rod during turning The utility model has the advantages that the shock absorption stroke is not occupied when the tires are crossed the same adhesive force and bearing capacity of the tires on the same bridge are same the floating and sinking distance of the tires is widened to strengthen the offroad performance half bumping is actively reduced the buffering shock absorption of multiple spring strokes is added and the nodding and warping during speed reduction are improved the height of the chassis and the frontback leftright and leftright inclination of the vehicle body are controlled in real time the value of inclination towards the inner side of a bend is actively enhanced during turning the driving comfort is enhanced and flat roads and wild land are compatible for passing
