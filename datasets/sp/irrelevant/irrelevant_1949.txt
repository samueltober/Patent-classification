 CNA     The invention discloses a twostage damping active suspension with no loss of function after a failure and a working method thereof comprising a first oil cylinder a first piston rod a first adjustable flow valve a second accumulator and a first solenoid valve The traditional vibration reduction structure composed of the first accumulator and the second oil cylinder the second piston rod the permanent magnet synchronous motor the pump or the motor the second adjustable flow valve the inertia spiral tube the second solenoid valve The active or antiresonance damping structure composed of the third accumulator and the third accumulator When the active or antiresonance damping structure fails the first solenoid valve is normally open the first adjustable flow valve is in a medium flow state and the second solenoid valve is normally The closed and second adjustable flow valve is in the minimum flow state the third mass of the suspension the unsprung mass and the sprung mass form a threemass vibration structure which improves the overall performance of the suspension in active and passive working conditions and active or antiresonant vibration reduction After the structure fails the active damping function is transformed into an antiresonance damping function with larger inertia and larger damping
