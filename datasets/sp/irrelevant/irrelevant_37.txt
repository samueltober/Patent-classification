 EPA An active suspension system is configured in a strut arrangement The active suspension system comprises a hydraulic actuator and a hydraulic pumpelectric motor assembly wherein the actuator movement is preferably in lockstep with the hydraulic motorpump and electric motorgenerator combination Torque in the electric motor is instantaneously controlled by a controller to create an immediate force change on the hydraulic actuator The hydraulic actuator is configured so that it can be used as a strut whereby the actuator has sufficient structural rigidity to carry the applied suspension loads while capable of supplying damper forces in at least three quadrants of the force velocity graph of the suspension actuator operation Embodiments disclosed include low cost active suspension systems for a MacPherson strut application
