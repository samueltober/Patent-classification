 EPB The present invention relates to a power control apparatus for submodules in a Modular Multilevel Converter MMC which controls the supply of power to submodules in an MMC connected to an HVDC system and to a STATCOM The power control apparatus includes a halfbridge circuit unit for switching multiple switches converting an input voltage across P and N buses of the MMC into a relatively low voltage and outputting the low voltage a transformer for transferring the low output voltage primary side output through switching of the switches in the halfbridge circuit unit via switching of the switches to a secondary side of the transformer a DCDC converter for converting an output voltage on the secondary side of the transformer a photocoupler for outputting a reference signal corresponding to a magnitude of the secondary side output voltage of the transformer a Pulse Width Modulation PWM control unit for controlling switching of the switches in the halfbridge circuit unit in response to the reference signal output from the photocoupler and a starting circuit unit for supplying an initial starting voltage to the PWM control unit wherein the PWM control unit is started in response to the starting voltage initially supplied from the starting circuit unit and is configured to control switching of the switches in response to the reference voltage received from the photocoupler and to receive the secondary side output voltage of the transformer as an operating voltage depending on the switching thus being operated
