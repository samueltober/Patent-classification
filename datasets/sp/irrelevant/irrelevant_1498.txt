 CNA An electromagnetic active suspension comprises a suspension assembly an electromagnetic actuator a speed reducer a rocker arm and a pushpull rod An output shaft of the electromagnetic actuator isconnected with the input end of the speed reducer and can drive the input end of the speed reducer to rotate the output end of the speed reducer is connected with one end of the rocker arm and can drive the rocker arm to rotate the other end of the rocker arm is rotatably connected with the pushpull rod and the other end of the pushpull rod is rotatably connected with the suspension assembly According to the electromagnetic active suspension approximate linear motion between the sprung mass and the unsprung mass of the suspension assembly and rotary motion of the electromagnetic actuator can be mutually converted and by controlling the relative motion between the sprung mass and the unsprung mass the comfort performance and the operation stability performance of an automobile areimproved The electromagnetic active suspension is simple in structure and lower in cost not only has the advantage of quick response of the electromagnetic actuator but also is higher in system efficiency and can recover the energy of vertical vibration of the automobile
