 CNA A backtoback seriesparallel Hbridge converter control method and device are suitable for a rail transit inphase power supply system A converter is composed of a plurality of commissioning modules and standby modules one side of each module Hbridge is cascaded to form highvoltage output and the other side of each module Hbridge is connected to a lowvoltage winding of a traction matchingtransformer During normal work the commissioning module undertakes a power transmission task the parallel side contactor of the standby module is closed the parallel side pulse is blocked the lower tube IGBTs of the two bridge arms on the cascade side are conducted for follow current and the upper tube IGBTs of the two bridge arms on the cascade side are turned off to be in a lowpowerconsumption quasihot standby state When the commissioning module breaks down the cascade side bypass switch of the module is closed the parallel side contactor is disconnected the module is rapidly cut off and meanwhile the parallel side pulse and the cascade side pulse of the standby module are unlocked and converted into the running state According to the invention the system loss can be effectively reduced the response time is short and the system efficiency is considered while the system reliability is improved
