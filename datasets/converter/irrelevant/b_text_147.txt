 EPA The invention relates to a method for switching off a switchable bipolar power semiconductor component  In the method the gate emitter voltage VGE of the power semiconductor component  is reduced from a first voltage value V to a second voltage value V at a first average voltage change rate dVGEdt starting in a first time period tt in response to a switchoff signal In a second time period tt the gate emitter voltage VGE is then kept constant or is reduced to a third voltage value V wherein the gate emitter voltage has a second average voltage change rate dVGEdt in the second time period and the value of the second average voltage change rate dVGEdt is less than the value of the first average voltage change rate dVGEdt
