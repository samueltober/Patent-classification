The invention provides a wireless remote transmission electromagnetic flowmeter power supply system The system is provided with an impedance matching circuit a bidirectional silicon controlled rectifier switching capacitor is used and a series capacitor is used for impedance matching to improve the power factor of a load sensor so that the load of a power supply is reduced reactive power generated by an excitation coil is reduced and the output power of the excitation coil is improved A power frequency power amplification circuit is arranged to convert the obtained direct current into power frequency alternating current and it is guaranteed that the excitation current in the excitation coil is larger than  A current The apparent power of an original alternatingcurrent excitationelectromagnetic flowmeter is reduced from  VA to  VA through the impedance matching circuit and the power frequency power amplification circuit and the use power consumption is greatly reducedso that the alternatingcurrent excitation system can realize battery power supply
