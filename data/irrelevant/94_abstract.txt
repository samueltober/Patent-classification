The invention relates to a modular power converter which is configured from at least one main module to be actively supplied and an arbitrary number of N further modules All modules are connected to one another in series for example by modular terminals where the term modular terminals shall also comprise any other kind of electrical connection and in particular plug connections Each module comprises switching devices and at least one energy storage device as a result of which the individual module is capable of being charged with an adjustable voltage The switching devices which are preferably realized by transistors allow the module to be connected according to an active operation in terms of the series connection or according to a bypass operation in which case the respective module is quasi bridged and therefore cannot contribute to the voltage path of the series connection The output voltage of the power converter is tapped at the end points of the series connection
