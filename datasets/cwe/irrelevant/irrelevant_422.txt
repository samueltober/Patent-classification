 JPA To provide nut loosening prevention means which is easily assembled in a bearing device for a wheel in which a hub unit and a constant velocity universal joint are coupledSOLUTION A bearing device  for a wheel includes an outer member  in which outer raceway grooves   are formed at an inner periphery an inner member  having inner raceway grooves a b facing the outer raceway grooves   and formed at an outer periphery and a center hole  penetrating therethrough in an axial direction and multiple rolling elements disposed between the outer raceway grooves   and the inner raceway grooves a b in a rollable manner A shaft a of a constant velocity universal joint  is inserted into the center hole  and a nut  is threadedly engaged with a male screw part  provided at a tip of the shaft part a A rotation stopping member  which restricts rotation of the nut  is fixed to the inner member  by threadedly engaging a screw part of the inner member  with a screw part of the rotation stopping member  and tightening the screw partsSELECTED DRAWING Figure
