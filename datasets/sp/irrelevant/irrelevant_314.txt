 CNB The invention discloses a wheel device of an omnidirectional mobile robot and relates to the technical field of robots The robot comprises a mobile robot body a rotating driving mechanism for driving wheels to rotate a steering driving mechanism for driving the wheels to steer a chassis and wheel mechanism for supporting and connecting a damping device for damping and a transmission mechanism for transmission power On the basis that a common wheel structure is not changed a rotating drive motor and a steering drive motor are fixedly installed a spline shaft is adopted the drivingsteering and damping functions are integrated the modularized integrated design of the wheel device is obtained the drive motor and the steering motor achieve wheel rotation and steering independentdrive under the control of the controller wheel rotation caused in the steering process is decoupled the coupling effect is eliminated it is ensured that wheels are rotated and steered flexibly achassis and the robot body are connected through an air spring and the stability and comfort level of the mobile robot body are improved
