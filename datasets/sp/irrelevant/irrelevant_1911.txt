 CNA     The fuzzy control method of active suspension system based on frequency domain characteristics to improve comfort belongs to the technical field of automobile suspension control which involves solving how to make the closedloop control system of automobile active suspension progressively stable and have the best limited frequency domain disturbance suppression performance index Then the problem of improving the comfort of the car firstly establish the dynamic equation of the car active suspension system consider the change of the car load establish the TakagiSugeno TS fuzzy model of the car active suspension system then design the distributed compensation fuzzy The controller obtains the closedloop suspension control system gives the performance index for describing the finite frequency domain disturbance of human comfort based on the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality technology the closedloop active suspension system stability and finite frequency domain disturbance The suppression performance is proved it solves the problem of the complex situation of car loadbearing changes and effectively enhances the disturbance suppression performance of the suspension control system according to the sensitive frequency domain characteristic information of the human body thereby improving the comfort of the car
