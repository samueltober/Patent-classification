 CNB The invention mainly relates to a system integrated with a high frequency switching power supply and a direct voltage converter and a communication method A power line for transmitting power is connected between the direct voltage converter and the high frequency switching power supply The direct voltage converter transmits the direct power to the high frequency switching power supply An electromagnetic interference filter for suppressing noise is provided on the power line The electromagnetic interference filter is provided with a first inductor that is closer to the high frequency switching power supply than the direct voltage converter on the power line The processor configured on the high frequency switching power supply drives a first switch coupled between a first direct voltage source and a terminal of the first inductor for high frequency switching between on and off thereby generating carrier signals as an oscillator
