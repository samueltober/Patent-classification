 CNA The invention discloses a supporting beam structure for an automobile air suspension The structure comprises a uniform crosssection middle shaft section and the variable crosssection sections extending from two sides of the middle shaft section the variable crosssection sections are symmetrically bent along the radial center of the middle shaft section to form the Cshaped beam structures and a supporting structure is arranged in an inner cavity of the middle shaft section and is provided with the surface supporting faces and the supporting tables The two surface supporting faces at least make contact with the two opposite bearing force inner walls in the inner cavity of the middle shaft section respectively and the supporting tables on the two surface supporting faces serve as theinternal supports of the two opposite bearing force inner walls The device has the advantages that the ratio of the cross section factor to the cross section area is larger so that the structure ismore reasonable the bending resistance is stronger and the structure is more reasonable and safer the weight is lighter due to the adoption of a reasonable decrement structure the strength rigidity inherent frequency and resonance phenomenon of the beam are ensured the general requirements are met but also the potential safety hazards of unbalance loading breakage and rollover easily caused by different vehicle models are solved
