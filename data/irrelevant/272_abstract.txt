DeliveryLocation Recharging During Aerial Transport Tasks Methods and systems for recipientassisted recharging during delivery by an unmanned aerial vehicle UAV are disclosed herein During a UAV transport task a UAV determines that the UAV has arrived at a delivery location specified by a first flight leg of the transport task The UAV responsively initiates a notification process indicating that a recipientassisted recharging process should be initiated at or near the delivery location When the UAV determines that the recipientassisted recharging process has recharged a battery of the UAV to a target level and also determines that a nonreturnable portion of the payload has been removed from the UAV while a returnable portion of the payload is coupled to or held by the UAV the UAV initiates a second flight segment of the transport task
