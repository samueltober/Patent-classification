 CNA The invention discloses a highadjustmentstroke axle hanging system of a multiaxle wheeled vehicle The axle hanging system comprises a frame and an axle A hanging structure with a hydraulic cylinder for force bearing and an elastic element for buffering is arranged between the frame and the axle The upper end of the hydraulic cylinder is supported at the bottom of the frame and the lower endof the hydraulic cylinder is supported on the side face of the axle The lower end of the hydraulic cylinder is lower than the axis of the axle The hydraulic cylinder is supported on the side face of the axle instead of being directly supported above the axle so it is ensured that the hydraulic cylinder has a larger size and a higher stroke and the axle has a higher adjustment stroke in the vertical height When the structure is adopted for all axles of the multiaxle wheeled vehicle the multiaxle wheeled vehicle has high selfadaptability to road surfaces and the drivingthrough efficiency of the vehicle on bumpy roads is greatly improved
