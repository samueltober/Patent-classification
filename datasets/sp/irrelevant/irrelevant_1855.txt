 CNA The invention discloses a suspension device a chassis device and selfmoving equipment The suspension device comprises a guide buffer mechanism and a damping mechanism The guide buffer mechanism is arranged between a suspension bracket and a chassis along the vertical direction the damping mechanism is connected in series with the guide buffer mechanism and when the distance between the suspension bracket and the chassis is changed the guide buffer mechanism provides buffer between the suspension bracket and the chassis and the damping mechanism provides damping in at least one changing direction By means of the guide buffer mechanism arranged in the vertical direction linear motion of a driving wheel set in the vertical direction during obstacle crossing can be limited buffering between the suspension bracket and the chassis can be provided and the damping mechanism is connected to the guide buffer mechanism in series so that damping can be provided for the guide buffer mechanism when the guide buffer mechanism conducts buffering and the guide buffer mechanism and the damping mechanism are simple in structure and are connected only in the vertical direction the occupied space of the structure is reduced and the obstacle crossing and damping effects can be improved
