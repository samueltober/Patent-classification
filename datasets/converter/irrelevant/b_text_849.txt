 USB The present general inventive concept is directed to a signal generation system device and method for meter testing including a digital signal generator to generate an arbitrary digital test signal a digitaltoanalog converter to convert the arbitrary digital test signal to an analog test signal a signal converter to convert the analog test signal to a differential pair of signals corresponding to the analog test signal and a power signal generator including an input module to receive the differential pair of signals an amplifier to amplify the differential pair of test signals and an output module to output an output differential pair of signals to a load to feed back a proportional representation of the output differential pair of signals to the input module and to receive the amplified differential pair of signals from the amplifier
