 CNB The invention discloses a selecting method for offshore frequency dividing cable power transmission system configuring schemes and the method belongs to the field of power system planning and flexible power transmission technology According to the transmission capacity to be transmitted by offshore wind farms the transmission voltage level of the transmission system of an offshore frequency dividing cable power transmission system is determined and the configuration parameters of the frequency conversion station are designed for transmission The power supply carrying capacity required by the cable is determined according to the transmission capacity and voltage level and based on the power frequency carrying flow initial selection of sea bottom cables is performed Based on the optimal frequency selection method the optimal transmission frequency of the current system is selected to determine the optimal transmission frequency of the frequency dividing flow If the frequency dividing flow is  times smaller than the work frequency flow the frequency transmission system and the sea bottom cable transmission frequency are determined otherwise the sea bottom cables are selected again The invention has the advantages that the problem that the transmission capacity and economy of different frequency division transmission systems can not be optimized is solved that the balance between the transmission power and the system economy of the frequency division cable transmission system is found and that the optimal system configuration of the frequency division cable transmission system is obtained
