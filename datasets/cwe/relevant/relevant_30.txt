 EPB A sensorequipped wheel support bearing assembly capable of accurately estimating a load acting on a wheel without the detecting accuracy deteriorated as a result of a long term use andor a change in environment is provided The assembly includes a sensor unit provided in an outer member which serves as a stationary member The sensor unit has a strain generator and a sensor for detecting a strain occurring in the generator A principal load estimator estimates the load acting on the wheel with the use of an average value of a signal from the sensor and an amplitude processed load estimator estimates the load using amplitude of a signal wave outputted from the sensor resulting from passage of rolling elements A drift amount estimator estimates a drift amount of an estimated load output utilizing the average value and the amplitude which is used to correct the estimated load
