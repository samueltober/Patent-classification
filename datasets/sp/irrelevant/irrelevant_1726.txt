 CNA The invention discloses a composite hydropneumatic spring device with a selfcooling function The composite hydropneumatic spring device with the selfcooling function comprises a hydropneumatic spring body a motion conversion mechanism and a cooling mechanism the motion conversion mechanism is arranged at the upper end of the hydropneumatic spring body and the cooling mechanism is arranged in the hydropneumatic spring body during use additional damping is provided to dissipate a part of vibration energy in the mode that the ball screw drives the external load the energy is converted into compressor acting to drive the cooling system to work and a refrigerant is used for forcibly absorbing heat inside the hydropneumatic spring and forcibly releasing heat outside the hydropneumatic spring And meanwhile when the system operates the work of the compressor can be adaptively changed along with the vibration heating rate of the hydropneumatic spring the heat dissipation efficiency of the hydropneumatic spring is effectively improved while the energy utilization efficiency is improved and the composite hydropneumatic spring device has the characteristics of high utilization rate and high heat dissipation efficiency
