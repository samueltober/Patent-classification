 USA A power conversion device includes a transformer a plurality of converter cells and a control circuit that controls semiconductor switching elements in each of the converter cells to be turned on and off The transformer includes a primary winding group being connected in multiple phases to an AC power supply including multiple phases and a plurality of secondary winding groups Each secondary winding group includes in each of the multiple phases secondary windings each formed of a singlephase open winding Each converter cell converts a singlephase AC voltage between AC nodes connected to the respective secondary windings into a DC voltage by control of the semiconductor switching elements to be turned on and off and outputs the converted DC voltage between a pair of DC nodes The DC nodes of the plurality of converter cells are connected in series between a first DC terminal and a second DC terminal
