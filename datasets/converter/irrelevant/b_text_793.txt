 CNA The invention provides a coordination control technical design scheme for improving the complex fault ridethrough capability of an offshore wind power flexible multiterminal collection system The scheme comprises the following steps  a steadystate simulation verification control strategy determining a basic control strategy mentioned in the invention thereby enabling a multiterminal network to operate normally and safely in a steady state  verifying the feasibility of the scheme by implementing faults on the master station power grid the slave station power grid and the wind power plant and enabling the system to operate stably when a single fault is verified and  implementing complex multiple faults to verify and analyze the comprehensive complex fault ridethrough coordination control strategy and simultaneously implementing faults on the master station power grid the slave station power grid and the wind power plant to form a complex fault environment When the DC bus voltage drops the system is switched to a complex fault ridethrough coordination control strategy under masterslave scheduling control and redundant power is discharged through switching operation of the hybrid DC ETO control unloading circuit so that the purpose of stabilizing and balancing the DC bus voltage is achieved
