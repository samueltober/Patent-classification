A circuit for turning off a power semiconductor switch includes a turnoff transistor coupled to switch a signal for turning off the power semiconductor switch onto a control terminal of the power semiconductor switch and a feedback control loop for controlling a voltage on the control terminal of the power semiconductor switch during turnoff The feedback loop includes a feedback path to feedback a measurement of the voltage of the control terminal of the power semiconductor switch a control terminal reference voltage generator to generate a timedependent reference voltage an error amplifier to generate an error signal representative of a difference between the voltage of the control terminal and the timedependent reference voltage and a forward path to convey the error signal forward for controlling the switching of the signal for turning off the power semiconductor switch onto the control terminal of the power semiconductor switch by the turnoff transistor
