 USB An exemplary method is disclosed for estimating operational efficiency of a marine vessel with a propeller mounted to a rotatable shaft for converting rotative shaft power transferred from the shaft to the propeller into thrust to propel the marine vessel across water the method including obtaining a respective time series of values for operating parameters of the marine vessel constructing a multidimensional power matrix for a first time period based on operating parameter values within a respective subseries thereof that represents a first time period computing for one or more propulsion parameters fouling values based on information stored in the power matrix and information stored in a base matrix of a reference fouling level and creating indications concerning operating status of the marine vessel in dependence of the fouling values
