The invention provides a multimode depression detection method and system based on a time convolutional neural network The detection method specifically comprises the following steps constructing a training sample set wherein the training sample set comprises audios D facial expressions and corresponding text information of depression and nondepression patients performing D facial expression feature extraction on the training sample set to obtain a D facial expression feature vector with context awareness the feature extraction module is used for performing acoustic feature extraction on the audio signals of the training sample set in combination with a Melfrequency cepstrum coefficient to obtain voice vector features with context awareness using a Transform model for processing word embedding of the training sample set and obtaining text features with context awareness fusing the D facial expression features the voice vector features and the text features to obtain information for depression classification and substituting the information for depression classification into the time convolutional neural network to obtain depression classification information According to the invention the accuracy of depression detection can be improved
