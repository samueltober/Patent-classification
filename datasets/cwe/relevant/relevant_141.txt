 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To improve strength of an outer ring in a hub unit bearing applying a various diameter PCD constitution in which an outer ring flange and an inner ring flange are close to each other the outer ring flange is radially superposed to an outer raceway surface and PCD of a rolling element of an outer row is larger than PCD of a rolling element of an inner rowSOLUTION An outer raceway surface a of an outer row and an outer ring flange c are radially superposed a pitch circle diameter PD of a rolling element a of the outer row is configured to be larger than a pitch circle diameter PD of a rolling element b of an inner row an inclined face portion  is disposed between the outer ring raceway surface a of the outer row and the outer ring raceway surface b of the inner row the outer ring raceway surface a of the outer row and the outer ring raceway surface b of the inner row are provided with hardened layers a and a boundary of the hardened layer a disposed on the outer ring raceway surface a of the outer row and a nonhardened layer is positioned at an axial outer side with respect to a thin region  between a relief recessed portion e of the outer ring flange c and the inclined face portion SELECTED DRAWING Figure
