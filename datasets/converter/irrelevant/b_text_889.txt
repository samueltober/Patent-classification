 WOA A multi port converter includes a hybrid energy storage system HESS that provides a faster dynamic response to load changes than prior art systems and enables either downsizing of the main energy storage system ESS to increase the life of the main ESS eg energy battery or retaining the same size ESS and increasing the range or life of the power source The multiport convertor can advantageously result in lower investment and maintenance costs and can also advantageously provide a path for inputs to directly feed the load All these benefits can be achieved while reducing the number of active switches and overall component count as compared to prior art systems
