 CNU The utility model discloses a ground selfadaptive driving suspension structure of an omnidirectional latent traction AGV which comprises a driving mounting plate a counterweight bearing seat a follower wheel mounting support a counterweight rotating shaft a counterweight rotating shaft support seat a counterweight limiting plate a counterweight rotating shaft pin a follower wheel a driving wheel mechanism a counterweight rotating shaft bearing a and a counterweight rotating shaft bearing b wherein the driving mounting plate is connected with the followup wheel through the trundlesupport the driving wheel and the followup wheel are mounted at two ends of the driving mounting plate the driving mounting plate is connected through a fulcrum of the counterweight rotating shaftto form a suspension structure swinging around the fulcrum and the counterweight rotating shaft support is connected to the frame When an uneven ground moves the driving wheels and the driven wheels on the two sides are affected to enable the driving wheels to be stressed unevenly under the action of gravity the driving mounting plate can deflect and float around the balance weight rotatingshaft and therefore the driving wheels and the driven wheels can touch the ground to be stressed evenly the protection of the load condition on the object can be improved and stable movement and noshaking are achieved
