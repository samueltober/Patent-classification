 CNU The utility model discloses a reducing ball differentcontactangle hub bearing which relates to the technical field of bearings and particularly relates to a reducing ball differentcontactangle hub bearing which comprises a first flange plate a bearing outer ring is propped against the inside of the first flange plate a steel ball is propped against the inside of the bearing outer ring one side of the steel ball is propped against a retainer and the other side of the retainer is propped against the bearing outer ring And the bottom of the retainer is propped against a bearing inner ring Through the arrangement of the retainer and the steel ball the bearing has the effect of improving the bearing capacity and through the matched arrangement of the supporting block and the limiting sleeve in the use process axial and radial forces borne by different road conditions can be transmitted to the central position of a wheel of the hub bearing in the running process of a vehicle so that the service life of the wheel is prolonged By adding a row of steel balls with different diameters the bearing capacity of the bearing can be effectively improved the contact angle is increased by one row the axial bearing capacity is improved and fatigue peeling is improved so that the effect of improving the bearing capacity is achieved and the purposes of high stability and good practicability are achieved
