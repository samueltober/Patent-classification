 EPA Provided is a slide bearing capable of sustaining sliding performance over long periodA slide bearing has an upper case  configured to be attached to an upper support for attachment of a suspension to a vehicle body a lower case  rotatably combined with the upper case  to form an annular space  and an annular center plate  and an annular sliding sheet  both placed within the annular space   The center plate  includes a bearing surface  slidable with the sliding sheet  and an annular groove  formed on the bearing surface  so as to hold lubricant The annular groove  has an inner circumferential surface a inclining down from the opening section toward the groove bottom section as it goes outwardly in the radial direction and an outer circumferential surface b inclinining down from the opening section toward the groove bottom section as it goes inwardly in the radial direction A line P of intersection between the inner circumferential surface a and the outer circumferential surface b is located closer to the bearing surface  than to a back face  of the center plate
