 CNA     The invention discloses a cylindrical cam type reciprocating inertia container device which comprises a left connecting block a limit bearing a cylindrical cam a cylindrical sliding block an outer cylinder and a spline bushing The cylindrical cam type reciprocating inertial container device utilizes a variant cylindrical cam structure to realize the conversion from the reciprocating linear motion of the outer cylinder to the reciprocating rotary motion of the cylindrical cam generating an inertia effect forming an inertial container and enriching the structure of the inertial container type In addition the biggest difference between the present invention and the previous mechanical inertia container device is that it eliminates the existence of the flywheel that is the inertia is no longer dependent on the flywheel but is provided by the barrel cam itself which greatly simplifies the structure of the device and improves the operation Stablize
