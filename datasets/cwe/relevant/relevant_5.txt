 DEB     A wheel bearing device for a vehicle wheel comprisingan outer member   formed on its inner circumference with tworow outer raceway surfaces a b with shoulder portions   being formed between the tworow outer raceway surfaces a b the shoulder portions    are designed as cylindrical sections the shoulder sections   being at different radial distances from the axis of the wheel bearing device a step section a a is designed with a conical crosssection or with a circular arc crosssection between the cylindrical sections the outer member   having a thin wall with a minimum wall thickness t t on the tworow outer raceway surfaces a b of  mm to reduce the size and weight of the wheel bearing device with increasing rigidityan inner member   which includes a wheel hub   which at one of its ends integrally forms a wheel mounting flange  and is formed on its outer circumferential surface with tworow inner raceway surfaces a a which the tworow outer raceway surfaces a b are arranged opposite one another anddouble row balls   freely rollable between the outer raceway surfaces a b and inner raceway surfaces a a of the outer member   and the inner member   respectively wherein a pitch circle diameter PCDo of the tworow ball group  on the outside is greater than a pitch circle diameter PCDi of the tworow ball group  on the insidewherein at least the outer member   and the wheel hub   are formed from medium  high carbon carbon steel containing  to  weight percent carbonwherein the wheel hub   and the outer member   can withstand a load when cornering a vehicle which corresponds to  G G acceleration due to gravitywherein the inner and outer raceway surfaces a a a b are each formed with predetermined hardened layers   with a surface hardness of  to  HRCthe hardened layers   being five times the depth in the case of the maximum shear load and the depth of the hardening layer becoming at least  mmwherein the grain size number of austenite crystal grains of metallographic structure in the hardened layers   is selected larger than number  anda distance L being provided between the tworow outer raceway surfaces a b the distance L being equal to or greater than  mm with a hardened layer  only in the tworow outer raceway surfaces a b  is provided and the shoulder sections   and the step section a a remain as nonhardened sections
