The utility model discloses a biological sample detection device which structurally comprises a display screen an indicating lamp a charging interface a power supply a function key a heat dissipation port a main body and a plurality of stages of detection chambers the display screen is riveted above the front end face of the main body the indicating lamp is arranged at the top of the mainbody and the charging interface is arranged above the right side of the main body The crystal resonator has the advantages that the design of the resonator is provided mechanical deformation and vibration of the power source can be generated by applying alternating voltage to the optical fiber layer the phenomenon is the inverse piezoelectric effect and when the frequency of external voltageis equal to the inherent frequency of the crystal resonator the power source can be converted into vibration through the inverse piezoelectric effect Therefore each electronic component can operatenormally and the beneficial effect that the detection is not easily influenced by the outside world is achieved
