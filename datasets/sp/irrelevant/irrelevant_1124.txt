 CNU The utility model relates to a chassis of an unmanned test dolly The chassis comprises a basic assembly a power assembly and a communication control assembly The independent suspension mechanism isarranged in the power assembly force acting between the driving wheel and the frame is transmitted in a multiconnectingrod mode impact force transmitted to the frame or a vehicle body from an uneven road surface is buffered vibration caused by the impact force is attenuated and therefore the driving stability of the unmanned test vehicle chassis is guaranteed Compared with a traditional swing arm structural type the trolley chassis has the buffering performance in the vertical direction and the lateral direction at the same time and the driving wheels are driven to move in a mutual dragging mode By arranging the tensioning mechanisms on the two sides of the swing arm of the servo driving wheel set it is guaranteed that the synchronous belt can always keep the preset tensioningforce in the transmission process and loosening and slipping are avoided
