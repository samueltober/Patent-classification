 CNA     After the centerless grinding process is performed the finishing process is performed In the centerless grinding process the inner ring  is relatively rotated in a predetermined direction with respect to the grindstone while pressing the grindstone to the inner ring  The sliding contact surface  thereby grinding the sliding contact surface  in the finishing process is implemented for forming the sliding contact surface  and forming the sliding contact surface  in the centerless grinding process Grinding texture in the direction where the grinding texture of the contact surface  intersects andor processing to improve the surface roughness of the sliding contact surface
