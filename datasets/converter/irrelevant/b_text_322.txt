 CNB     This application provides a multichannel MPPT inverter and its control method Compared with the prior art the control method for multiple MPPT inverters provided by this application is based on the received detection parameters of the multiple MPPT inverters after judging that all DCDC converters are in working state If it is further determined that the overall input level of the multichannel MPPT inverter meets the preset highinput voltage operation mode conditions all DCDC converters are shut down and the DCAC converters in the multichannel MPPT inverter are controlled Carry out the MPPT algorithm therefore when the high input voltage operation mode causes the photovoltaic battery string voltage to be higher the useless work of the frontstage DCDC converter is avoided the firststage power loss is reduced and the multichannel MPPT inverter is improved The conversion efficiency of the converter
