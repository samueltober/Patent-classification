 WOA The invention relates to an inner part  for a molecular joint  of a chassis link  wherein the inner part  comprises a ball piece  extending in the axial direction a thereof and having an at least substantially spherical bearing region  The spherical bearing region  is surrounded in an annular manner by two elastomer shell halves  which are adjacently arranged in the axial direction a of the inner part The inner part  is characterised in that the spherical bearing region  is embodied in a respectively uninterrupted circular manner in any plane extending perpendicularly to the axial direction a of the inner part  and the elastomer shell halves  are glued to the spherical bearing region  of the ball piece  in order to prevent the ball piece  from slipping through the two elastomer shell halves  particularly when torsion is applied to the inner part  The invention further relates to a chassis link  comprising a molecular joint
