 CNB The invention discloses a switchable suspension and a shock absorption energy feedback method thereof An existing vehicle suspension is only a single independent suspension or a nonindependent suspension The switchable suspension comprises an energy feedback shock absorption mechanism a separation and combination assembly and shock absorbers The separation and combination assembly comprises alocking male block a motor a lead screw a first axle and a second axle The energy feedback shock absorption mechanism comprises a connecting frame springs protective covers coils installationframes magnets piston rods cylinder bodies and supporting seats Each piston rod is composed of a connecting rod and a piston body which are integrally formed The bottom end of each connecting rod is connected with the corresponding piston body and the top end of each connecting rod is fixed to the connecting frame The connecting frame is hinged to an automobile chassis Each connecting rodand a lower supporting seat form a sliding pair The two ends of each spring are fixed to the connecting frame and the corresponding lower supporting seat The coils are wound round the connecting rods Compared with a traditional passive suspension the switchable suspension can reduce the intrinsic frequency of a vehicle and vehicle ride performance and control stability can be effectively improved as well
