 DEB     Method for reducing the deflection of an axle of a motor vehicle when loaded wherein each wheel of the axle is assigned a spring element a damper and a pressure stop buffer  the pressure stop buffer  interacting with a stop element  which is related to the pressure stop buffer  in the unloaded state of the motor vehicle at an empty response distance sDP is arranged characterized by the process stepsa determining an interruption of use of the motor vehicleb checking the load condition of the motor vehiclec If the check shows that the motor vehicle is unladen places one in relation to the empty response distance sDP reduced response distance sDP between the pressure stop buffer  and the stop element d determining the resumption of use of the motor vehiclee checking the loading conditionf If the check shows that the motor vehicle has been loaded the reduced response distance remains sDP setg If the check shows that the motor vehicle is unloaded the idle response distance sDP
