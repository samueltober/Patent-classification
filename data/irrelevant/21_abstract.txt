A modular management system for balancing testing and protecting rechargeable energy storage cells connected in series Different energy storage cell technologies can be connected in the same battery pack and they can be completely balanced by using one or both of two balancing modes In addition the modular management system includes bidirectional and unidirectional switches optionally connected to a single ohmic device such as a resistor to efficiently execute a Dual Function Process DFP ie passiveactive balancing and testing mode for SoHSoC estimation preferably without using any extra or external components ie capacitor or inductor or DCDC converter or power supply The systems and methods decrease the balancing time energy loss heat loss and complexity needed to monitor protect and balance energy storage cell systems such as battery systems and thus decreasing the overall cost
