 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a sound volume index value prediction method capable of predicting a magnitude of noises generated by a deformation by an impact load based on the specifications of a hub unitSOLUTION A sound volume index value prediction method for predicting an index value of noises after an impulse load is applied to a hub unit  from a wheel  includes a first step of calculating a surface pressure by which a rolling element  is pressed to orbit surfaces of an inner member  and an external member  based on specifications of the hub unit  a second step of calculating a total value of the depth at a contact angle position of an indentation generated on the orbit surface by the calculated surface pressure a third step of calculating of a shoulder riding over occurrence probability in which the shoulder riding over of the rolling element  occurs based on the specifications of the hub unit  a fourth step of calculating a total value of the crack heights that occur in the rolling element  based on the calculated shoulder riding over occurrence probability and a fifth step of calculating a sound volume index value by applying the total value of the calculated depth of the indentation and the total value of crack height to a predetermined calculation formulaSELECTED DRAWING Figure
