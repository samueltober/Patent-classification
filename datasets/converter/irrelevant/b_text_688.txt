 CNA The invention discloses a doublelayer bus island microgrid system comprising two microgrid subsystems and a hybrid energy storage system wherein the two microgrid subsystems and the hybrid energy storage system are connected with an intermediate bus through a bidirectional DCDC converter each microgrid subsystem comprises an independent directcurrent subgrid bus and the directcurrent busis used for connecting a power supply end to a load and the hybrid energy storage system is formed by connecting a supercapacitor with a leadacid storage battery in parallel According to the invention a multibus structure is adopted control is flexible and other microgrid subsystems cannot be affected even if a certain section of the directcurrent bus breaks down the problem that once asingle directcurrent bus structure breaks down the whole system collapses in the prior art is solved and the reliability and stability of directcurrent power supply can be effectively improved
