 CNU The highstrength forged hub with the anticollision structure comprises a main wheel and a first reinforcing rod an antiskid layer is bonded to the outer wall of the main wheel a fixing block is welded to the inner wall of the main wheel the first reinforcing rod is welded to the position close to the center point of a device of the fixing block and the first reinforcing rod is welded to the position close to the center point of the device of the fixing block A second reinforcing rod is welded to the end of the first reinforcing rod a main shaft is installed at the end of the second reinforcing rod a protective shell is arranged on the outer wall of the main shaft a protective rod is fixed to the front end of the protective shell an end block is welded to the rear end of the protective shell a rivet penetrates through the middle of the end block and a connecting disc is fixed to the outer wall of the bottom of the rivet According to the highstrength forged hub with the anticollision structure the antiskid layer is laid and attached to the outer wall of the main wheel the friction force between the main wheel and a tire can be increased the fallingoff condition is avoided the first reinforcing rod and the second reinforcing rod are correspondingly welded the second reinforcing rod can be used for reinforcing the first reinforcing rod and the anticollision structure is formed And easy breakage is prevented
