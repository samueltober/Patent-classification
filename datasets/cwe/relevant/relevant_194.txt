 CNA A sealing device for wheel hubs connected to constantvelocity joints includes a first sealing assembly arranged between inner and outer rings of the wheel hub and a second sealing assembly mounted on the inner ring and straddling the wheel hub and an outer ring of the constantvelocity joint The first sealing assembly has a signal generating element having an annular insert mounted externally on a shield facing the constantvelocity joint and extending axially projecting above part of an annular step formed on the same side as the constantvelocity joint on a radially outer side surface of the inner ring in a position immediately adjacent to the sleeve portion of the first shield The second sealing assembly includes a tubular support keyed onto the inner ring by its first end on theoutside edge folded in the manner of an L and shaped to engage inside the annular insert An annular sealing gasket is made of an elastic material and integrally mounted to the support to ensure fluid sealing protection for adjacent parts of the inner ring and the first shield
