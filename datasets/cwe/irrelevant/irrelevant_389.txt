 CNU The utility model discloses a hub The hub comprises a hub body and a hub cover the hub cover is connected to the hub body in a clamped mode The center of the hub body is provided with a damping block which protrudes out of the hub body to reduce impact force generated when the two hubs collide with each other A through hole is formed in the hub cover and used for the damping block to penetratethrough to extend to the outside of the hub cover The damping block is arranged in the center of the hub body of the hub impact force between the two carrying trolleys can be buffered when the twocarrying trolleys collide and therefore the situation that the shells are broken due to hard collision of the two carrying trolleys is effectively avoided
