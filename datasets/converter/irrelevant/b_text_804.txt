 CNA The invention discloses a threeport clamping type backtoback bridgeless threelevel rectifier and belongs to the technical field of power electronic converters The threeport clamping type backtoback bridgeless threelevel rectifier comprises a threeport clamping structure and a traditional rectifier bridge arm structure Compared with a traditional rectifier bridge arm the threelevel rectifier has the advantages that the threeport structure is used for clamping the capacitor voltage so that the voltage stress borne by each semiconductor device in the threeport structure is reduced Meanwhile an additional power branch is provided to be directly connected to the midpoint of the series capacitor According to the threelevel rectifier an extra power channel is provided and meanwhile due to the fact that a new diode structure is added the stability and reliability of a circuit are improved Compared with a traditional twolevel rectifier the rectifier has the advantages that the number of levels of phase voltage on the alternating current side can be three and the capacitance value can be remarkably reduced the voltage stress of the device is reduced the cost of capacitors and semiconductor devices is reduced and the size of the circuit is correspondingly increased due to the complexity of the threeport structure
