 CNB The invention discloses a multioutput power converter and a control method thereof Before the charge pump is started a series of short pulses are generated to precharge the pumping capacitor in thecharge pump through the DCDC converter before the DCDC converter and the charge pump start to operate the output voltages of the DCDC converter and the charge pump are still close to ground and do not start normal operation When the DCDC converter and charge pump start normally the surge current is greatly reduced because the pump capacitor has been fully or partially charged and the surge current of the system will be reduced to a safe level during the normal startup period
