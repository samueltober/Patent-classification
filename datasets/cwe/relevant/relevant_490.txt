 KRA The present invention relates to a hub with easy balancing during the eccentric moving of a vehicle wheel which is used for vehicle wheels and more specifically to a hub with easy balancing during the eccentric moving of a vehicle wheel capable of reducing outer diameter variations of an inner wheel According to the present invention the hub with easy balancing during the eccentric moving of a vehicle wheel includes a cylindrical hub body in which an inner wheel coupling part where an inner wheel is placed is formed and including a hollow part an orbital forming part extended in the inner wheel coupling part of the hub body having the same outer circumference surface as the hub body and having a thinner thickness than the hub body as the inner surface of a connection part with the hub body is stepped and a plurality of ribs provided radially on the inner surface of the connection part of the hub body and the orbital forming part According to the present invention outer diameter variations of an inner wheel after the orbital forming of a hub can be reduced manufacturing errors can be considerably reduced and eccentricity occurs relatively fewer times
