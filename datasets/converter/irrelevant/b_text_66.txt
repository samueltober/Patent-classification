 USA A multiphase power supply includes a plurality of phase controllers each driving a first terminal of a respective inductor alternatively between an input voltage and a ground voltage to regulate an output voltage in a work mode keeping the first terminal of the respective inductor in a high impedance state during a nonwork mode having an input for receiving an enable signal for selecting between the work mode and the nonwork mode and generating a current monitor signal to represent a current through the respective inductor during both the work mode and the nonwork mode and a controller coupled to each phase controller for selectively enabling respective ones of the phase controllers in response to a load demand receiving the current monitor signal from each phase controller and selectively shutting down the multiphase power supply when a total of current monitor signals from the phase controller exceeds a threshold
