 GBB The female part of the ball spindle joint is a through hole  the through hole being split into a first  a second  and a third region  by boundaries B C characterised in that the diameter of the second region  is greater than the third region  forming a clearance gap  between the shaft  of the ball spindle  and the second region  of the through hole  Thus the shaft  is in contact with the wall of the through hole at the first  and the third region  The first region  is the primary load bearing feature and the third region  secondary When a load fig  JF is applied to the ball  of the ball spindle  causing a moment fig  M the third region  may induce a counter force fig  CRF to balance the moment A fourth region  may form a second clearance gap fig   to prevent damaging the threads
