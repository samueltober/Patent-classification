 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To make an outside raceway surface into a complete round shape in a case where an outer ring used for a hub unit is manufactured by casting of light alloy steel into which an ironbased raceway member is insertedSOLUTION A hub unit  includes an outer ring  having doublerow outside raceway surfaces a a on its inner periphery a rotational shaft  having doublerow inside raceway surfaces   on its outer periphery and a plurality of rolling bodies  The outer ring  comprises a lightalloy steel casting A steel raceway member  on the inner periphery of which the outside raceway surfaces a a are formed is inserted into the outer ring in casting of the outer ring  On the outer periphery of the raceway member  before casting a shoe receiving surface  slidably contacting with a shoe is formed and after casting the shoe receiving surface  is exposed on the outer periphery of the outer ring SELECTED DRAWING Figure
