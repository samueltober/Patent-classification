The invention discloses a phaseshifting online ice melting method based on a flexible interconnected substation It connects a backtoback modular multilevel converter BBMMC device with a switch combination to the kV bus of a kV substation and operates normally Under working conditions the device operates in a flexible interconnection mode through the coordination and cooperation of switches to achieve active regulation of the overall power flow of the distribution network when the icecoated line needs to melt ice the adjustment switch combination modulates the device in the icemelting mode Realize the online ice melting of icecoated lines solve the obvious shortcomings of the existing technology for ice melting of kV medium voltage distribution network and there are problems such as the need to stop the line when the ice is melted the efficiency is not high and the short circuit is complicated
