 WOA In this structure the vehicle width direction outer end surface a of an outer race  of an outward side roller bearing  is positioned more on the vehicle width direction inward side than the vehicle width direction outer end surface a of an inner race  The vehicle width direction inner end surface  of a nut flange part  of a hub nut  is formed in a planar shape that is orthogonal to an axis CL of an axle case  A radial direction inward side region  of the vehicle width direction inner end surface  of the nut flange part  is in surface contact with the vehicle width direction outer end surface a of the inner race  of the outward side roller bearing  A radial direction outward side region of the vehicle width direction inner end surface  of the nut flange part  faces the vehicle width direction outer end surface a of the outer race  of the outward side roller bearing  from a position that is spaced apart from the vehicle width direction outer end surface a of the outer race  in the direction of the vehicle width direction outward side
