 CNA The invention discloses a drive axle of a ton forklift wheel loader An axle housing and a supporting shaft are welded to serve as a bearing part wheel edge assemblies are supported on the two sides a main speed reducer assembly is installed in the middle of the axle housing the two sides of a half shaft are connected with the wheel edge assemblies and the main speed reducer assembly an inner bearing  and an outer bearing  are respectively arranged in inner holes of a wheel shell so as to enhance the bearing capacity the wheel shell is supported on the supporting shaft through the two bearings an axle housing lug with an axle housing lug reinforcing rib is arranged on the axle housing the wall thickness of the axle housing lug reinforcing rib is  mm the axle housinglug reinforcing rib extends to the edge of the matching surface of a frame and the lug so as to meet the requirement of a heavyload working condition and during gear shaping of an inner gear ring reverse modification is conducted during machining according to collected heat treatment deformation trend data and it is ensured that the gear part is corrected after heat treatment so as to improvethe precision The drive axle solves the problems that in the prior art the bearing capacity of a wheel edge supporting shaft is insufficient axle housing lugs are prone to breakage under the heavyload working condition and the cracking failure rate of the inner gear ring is high
