 EPB Occurrence of jetting is prevented in injection molding of a protective cover having a thin separation wall in a disc part A protective cover  is molded through injection molding of a synthetic resin and includes a disc part  a sensor holder part  protruding inward from the disc part  and a protruding part  protruding inward from the disc part  and continuous with the sensor holder part  The disc part  includes a separation wall which is thinner than other portions of the disc part  and separates a magnetic encoder and a magnetic sensor from each other The protruding part  has at the inwardside face thereof a gate mark GM caused by the injection molding The protruding part  is provided with at the outwardside face thereof a thickness reduction part  extending inward so as to be close to the gate mark GM In the injection molding a molten synthetic resin material injected from a gate at the position of the gate mark GM collides with a columnar part for providing the thickness reduction part  thereby changing the flowing direction of the resin material to flow along the wall faces of the die This prevents jetting from occurring
