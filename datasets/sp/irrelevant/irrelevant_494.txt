 CNU A flexible suspension arm comprises a fixed supporting shaft a supporting arm body a bearing seat and a shock absorber The support arm is a curved arm with an upward arc surface the front end is in shaft connection with the support shaft and the tail end is downwards connected with the bearing seat A support is arranged on the upper portion of the supporting shaft a rear seat is arranged atthe high point of the cambered surface of the supporting arm the shock absorber is rotationally connected with the support in the forward direction and connected with the rear seat in the backward direction and the shock absorber is composed of a telescopic sleeve and spring sleeves fixed to the two ends of the telescopic sleeve The supporting shaft is directly connected and fixed with the rack the support is fixed and the rest are not fixed When the wheels are strongly impacted the supporting arms are lifted upwards the lifting force acts on the transverselyarranged telescopic shockabsorbers and the spring sleeves on the telescopic shock absorbers provide buffer damping The structure is simple the stress effect is good and the torque to all parts is small When the device is applied to agricultural machinery operation with a plurality of wheels as fulcrums the adaptability to farmland flatness is greatly enhanced local suspension and missing operation are avoided andthe operation quality of the machine is improved
