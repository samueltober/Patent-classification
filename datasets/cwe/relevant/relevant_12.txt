 EPB A bearing unit  has an axis of rotation A and is provided with a stationary ring  and a rotatable ring  arranged coaxially with respect to one another A magnetic encoder  is fixed onto the inner ring  and extends in front of an annular surface  of an axial lug  of the stationary ring  A protective cover  having a cylindrical side wall  is mounted on the outer surface of the axial lug  of the outer ring  so as to protect the encoder  and close off a space  defined between the two rings   An annular channel   is formed between the side wall  of the cover and the axial lug  of the stationary ring  sealing means  being arranged within the annular channel  so as to seal the cover  and prevent the infiltration of impurities between the cover  and the axial lug
