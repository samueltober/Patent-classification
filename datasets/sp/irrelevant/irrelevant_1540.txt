 CNA The invention relates to a plate spring movable end support assembly and a plate spring suspension system the plate spring movable end support assembly comprises a lifting lug support and a lifting lug and the lifting lug support is provided with a limiting pin one end of the lifting lug is rotationally connected to the lifting lug support the other end of the lifting lug is used for being rotationally connected to a plate spring and a groove body matched with the limiting pin is formed in the lifting lug The groove body comprises an avoiding subgroove and a limiting subgroove and thelimiting subgroove is located in the side away from the plate spring fixing end support of the avoiding subgroove and communicates with the avoiding subgroove The groove body is configured in the mode that when the plate spring is not broken the lifting lug avoids the limiting pin through the avoiding subgroove so as to rotate When the plate spring is broken the lifting lug abuts against the limiting pin through the limiting subgroove so as to stop rotating The defects that in the prior art a limiting mechanism is additionally arranged on a frame the number of parts is large assembling is complex and the requirement for arrangement of a whole vehicle is high can be overcome
