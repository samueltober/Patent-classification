 CNB The invention provides a target acoustic imaging and velocity measurement method and system based on pulse pair emission The method comprises the following steps applying pulse pair signals producedby a signal generator on an emission energy converter through a power amplifier and radiating acoustic wave to a medium receiving echo signals formed by the radiation acoustic wave through target scattering in the medium through all array elements of a receiving energy converter array and converting signals of all array element receiving channels into digital signals through multichannel signal collection performing delay superposition processing on receiving channel digital signals through the digital signal processor accomplishing the computation on all scanning beams to obtain the beamforming result and according to the beamforming result obtaining radial speed estimation of the target perpixel extracting time domain signal envelope of the beam and accomplishing the computation of the scanning beam to obtain a scanned acoustic image The speed estimation is performed on the pixels including point target when the acoustic imaging is realized thereby acquiring the radialspeed estimation of all targets in the dielectric
