An apparatus  for power conversion the apparatus comprising a controller  which receives feedback signals and which generates control signals to operate sets of switches  interconnected with charge pump capacitors CC the sets of switches implement a switching pattern for a charge pump based on the control signals to cycle the charge pump capacitors through different capacitor network configurations a particular capacitor network configuration of the different capacitor network configurations corresponds to a pumpstate of a plurality of pumpstates comprising a full operating cycle of the charge pump the plurality of pumpstates to comprise at least a first  see Figure  a second  see Figure  and a third  see Figure  pumpstate and the controller during the full operating cycle of the charge pump balances a total change in charge on the charge pump capacitors via adjusting the switching frequency by varying duration of the first second andor third pumpstate based on the feedback signals Other ways to regulate charge are also described The feedback signals may be indicative of charge imbalance in the capacitors
