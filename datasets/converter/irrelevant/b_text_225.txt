 JPB To simultaneously reduce a leakage current in a load connected to a multilevel inverter circuit on a main machine side and a leakage current in a load connected to an inverter circuit on an auxiliary machine sideSOLUTION A power converter includes a converter circuit  for generating an intermediate voltage a multilevel inverter circuit  controlled in three levels an inverter circuit  into which the intermediate voltage is input for driving a controller  for controlling the multilevel inverter circuit  and the inverter circuit  and at the same time controlling the converter circuit  so that the intermediate voltage is maintained at a preset voltage The generated intermediate voltage is used for an intermediate voltage of the multilevel inverter circuit  and an input voltage of the inverter circuit  together Therefore leakage currents in the load connected to the multilevel inverter circuit  and the load connected to the inverter circuit  are simultaneously suppressedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
