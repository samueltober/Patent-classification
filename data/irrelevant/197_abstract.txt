The invention provides a DC voltage oscillation suppression method for a cascade system By introducing a cascaded DC bus voltage compensation with differential characteristics an openloop transferfunction model of a frontend DCDC converter is modified a forward converter openloop transfer function with an equivalent positive resistive load is obtained the design of a preconverter closedloop controller is carried out according to the openloop transfer function an obtained controller can improve the stability of the DC bus voltage of a cascade side the influence of the equivalent negative resistance characteristic of a poststage converter existing in the model is eliminated the design problem of the control system with a preconverter with a constant power load is simplifiedthe obtainment of a highperformance cascade power converter system is helped and the stability and dynamic performance of the cascade side DC bus voltage of the cascade converter can be improved
