The invention discloses a composite material box thermal diaphragm preforming device and a working method thereof The device comprises a working table a diaphragm apparatus a thermal insulation door a heating chamber a mold I a mold II an exhaust system and a control system Compared with traditional thermal diaphragm preforming process steps the working table has the characteristic of double molds and three stations a preparation link a machining link and a discharging link are performed at the same time the whole process steps are optimized the complexity of the process flow islowered the preforming production efficiency is improved and the machining period is five minutes per piece Compared with a mold structure of a traditional thermal diaphragm preforming processa plurality of vacuum pipelines are disposed in the molds the whole course communicates with a vacuum source a diaphragm can be completely attached to all R angles occurrence of failure forms suchas Rangle surface bridging fiber inplane buckling and outofplane folding is avoided and the forming quality of the R angles of a box type structure can be improved without change of the processflow
