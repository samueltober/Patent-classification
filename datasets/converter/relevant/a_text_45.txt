 USB A multilevel switching power converter includes a multilevel power stage circuit which converts an input power to an output power The power stage circuit includes an inductor a conversion capacitor and plural power switches The controller circuit controls the multilevel power stage circuit and includes a feedback pulse generator circuit which generates a trigger pulse a first timer circuit and a second timer circuit which determine a first time period and a second time period respectively according to the trigger pulse and an adjusting circuit which adjusts the first time period according to a difference between the voltage across the conversion capacitor and a reference voltage such that an average of the voltage across the conversion capacitor is substantially equal to a level of the reference voltage
