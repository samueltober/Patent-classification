 CNB The invention discloses a flexible directcurrent power transmission converter The flexible directcurrent power transmission converter comprises a first series switch valve S a second series switch valve S a third series switch valve S a fourth series switch valve S a fifth series switch valve S a sixth series switch valve S a seventh series switch valve S an eighth series switch valve S a ninth series switch valve S a bus inductor Ls a capacitor Cf a first bridge arm inductor L a second bridge arm inductor L a first bridge arm A a second bridge arm A a third bridge arm A and a fourth bridge arm A Voltage conversion and power transmission are realized by controlling bridge arm voltage to enable each bridge arm connecting end to output required waveforms andmatching with a method of enabling an output port to output threephase sine voltage by switching on and switching off a series switch valve Compared with a traditional modular multilevel converterthe power transmission frequency of the upper bridge arm and the lower bridge arm is higher and the directcurrent voltage stress borne by the bridge arms is lower
