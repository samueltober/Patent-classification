 CNU The utility model relates to a force transmission structure at a lower thrust rod of a rear axle of a threesection type passenger car frame The force transmission structure comprises a thrust rod support base plate a longitudinal beam assembly a base plate reinforcing cross beam and a reinforcing beam assembly The thrust rod support base plate is arranged at the bottom of a plane formed by the luggage compartment lower longitudinal beam and the inner cross beam the stiffening beam straight pipe is arranged on one side of the luggage compartment lower longitudinal beam in parallel one end of the stiffening beam inclined pipe is connected with the stiffening beam straight pipe the other end of the stiffening beam inclined pipe is connected with the inner cross beam and the bottoms of the stiffening beam straight pipe and the stiffening beam inclined pipe are connected with the thrust rod support base plate One end of the longitudinal beam straight pipe is connected with the vertical inner longitudinal beam one end of the longitudinal beam inclined pipe is connected with the longitudinal beam straight pipe the other end of the longitudinal beam inclined pipe is connected with the inner longitudinal beam and the bottoms of the longitudinal beam straight pipe and the base plate reinforcing cross beam are connected with the thrust rod support base plate Compared with the prior art the connecting structure has the advantages that the risk that the rectangular pipes of the rear axle section and the luggage compartment section are torn due to stress is effectively reduced and meanwhile the connecting position of the luggage compartment section and the rear axle section frame module is reinforced
