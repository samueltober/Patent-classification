 WOA The invention relates to a method of determining that a failure has occurred at or in a wheel end bearing of a vehicle An estimated value of the temperature of the wheel end bearing is calculated by a processing circuitry A measured value of the temperature of the wheel end bearing is acquired by a temperature sensor The measured value is compared with the estimated value by the processing circuitry When the measured value deviates from the estimated value by a predefined difference or more then the processing circuitry determines that a failure has occurred The invention also relates to a system for determining that a failure has occurred
