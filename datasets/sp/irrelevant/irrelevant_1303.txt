 CNB The invention provides an active suspension faulttolerant control method based on a sliding mode observer The active suspension faulttolerant control method comprises the following steps S constructing a  vehicle suspension model is constructed S introducing parameter uncertainty and sensor faults into the  vehicle suspension model and then constructing a fault augmentation model based on a TS fuzzy model S estimating a sensor fault online in real time by constructing a sliding mode observer S constructing a development sliding mode input and faulttolerant controller based on the sensor fault obtained by realtime online estimation and S performing simulation verification on the development sliding mode input and faulttolerant controller in the S based on a fault augmentation model According to the method the sensor fault estimation and faulttolerant controller can be finally realized the method has great significance in fault diagnosis and faulttolerant control of a vehicle suspension system the problems of performance deterioration and the like caused by sensor faults are solved and the riding comfort and the driving safety of the vehicle suspension are effectively improved
