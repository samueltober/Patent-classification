 WOA The invention relates to an inner part  for a molecular joint  of a chassis link  The inner part  has a ball piece  which extends in its axial direction a and has an at least substantially spherical bearing region  which is annularly enclosed by a onepiece elastomer body  The inner part  is characterised in that when viewed in the axial direction a of the ball piece  a sealing surface  is located on both sides of the spherical bearing region  said sealing surface surrounding the ball piece  in the shape of a cylinder jacket and also being unmachined The two sealing surfaces  are suitable for preventing an unintentional leakage of an initially lowviscosity elastomer compound when the elastomer body  is produced in an elastomer injection moulding process The invention also relates to a chassis link  comprising a molecular joint  and to a method for producing an inner part  for a molecular joint
