 CNB The invention provides a suspension device for a rear wheel which suppresses or cancels influence of a vertical force compliance steering at the beginning of turning A suspension device  comprisesa hub bearing support which supports a rear wheel of a vehicle in a manner that the rear wheel of the vehicle can rotate around an axis suspension links in which both endpoints are respectively swingably attached to a vehicle body and a hub bearing so that the hub bearing support is strokably supported a suspension spring which generates a reaction force corresponding to the relative displacement amount of the hub bearing support relative to the vehicle in the vertical direction and a damper which generates a damping force corresponding to the relative speed of the hub bearing support relative to the vehicle in the vertical direction The suspension device has the vertical force compliance steering characteristics in which the rear wheel is steered in the toein side or toeout side according to increase of a vertical force applied to a rear wheel tread The suspension device includes toe change generation means temporarily canceling or suppressing a toe change caused by the vertical force compliance characteristics at the beginning of turning of the vehicle
