 CNA The invention discloses a coordinated control method for a lowvoltage currentlimiting link of a multicircuit directcurrent system and relates to the technical field of power system control and the method comprises the steps firstly comprehensively considering two factors of active power and reactive power and evaluating the influence degree of each circuit directcurrent system on an alternatingcurrent and directcurrent hybrid power grid secondly calculating reactive voltage sensitivity among converter stations of each direct current system and finally determining a control strategy and related parameters of the lowvoltage currentlimiting link coordination control method based on the calculation result The reactive interaction influence among the multicircuit direct current systems is considered the risk of commutation failure caused by reactive interaction can be effectively reduced and thus coordination recovery of the multicircuit direct current systems is promoted
