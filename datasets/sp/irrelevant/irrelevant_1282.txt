 CNU A constantpressure support for an AGV automatic adjusting spring comprises a bottom base a servo motor is arranged on one side of the bottom base an adjusting spring assembly is arranged on the other side of the bottom base the adjusting spring assembly is connected with a driving wheel through a driving wheel support and the adjusting spring assembly is used for adjusting the height of a trolley The rotation power of the servo motor is converted into the expansion amount of the spring in the length direction so that the pretightening force of the spring can be changed along with the change of the pressure borne by the driving wheel and the problems that an existing AGV is not located on the same horizontal line and the shaking amplitude of the AGV is large are solved
