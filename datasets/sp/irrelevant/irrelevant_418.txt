 CNA The invention relates to a suspension for motor vehicles having controllable ground clearance and comprising a helical spring  having a control apparatus  which is fastened to the body of the vehicle and is rotatably arranged preferably by means of a gear stage driven by an electric motor According to the invention the control apparatus  is designed as a shaped nut which is screwed directly onto the coils of the preferably cylindrical helical spring  and has rolling elements which are located along the helical curve and are connected to the coils of the helical spring whereinthe control apparatus  can be secured completely to the helical spring  and is movable relative thereto The suspension for motor vehicles ensures increased rigidity of the suspension when reducing ground clearance reduced rigidity of the suspension when increasing ground clearance and the possibility to install a telescoping damper within the helical spring without blocking access to thetop fastening point thereof
