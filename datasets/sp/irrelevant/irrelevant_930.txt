 CNA The invention discloses a twostage damping mechanism of an omnidirectional moving chassis The twostage damping mechanism comprises a chassis keel and wheel group modules The wheel group modules are arranged at the four corners of the chassis keel respectively and each wheel group module comprises a power motor Mecanum wheels and a secondstage damping mechanism Two fanshaped carbon platesare arranged on the two sides of the secondstage damping mechanism firststage damping is fixed to the fanshaped carbon plates the upper end of the firststage damping is connected with a doorshaped frame and the doorshaped frame is matched with a pin shaft a spring a guide wheel a spring seat and a linear bearing to form secondstage damping According to the omnidirectional moving chassis selfshock of the Mecanum wheels can be effectively filtered out through the firststage damping the requirement for stability of the chassis in most application scenes is met and the omnidirectional moving chassis can adapt to various complex and severe terrains through a secondstage damping mechanism formed by the firststage dampingand the secondstage damping
