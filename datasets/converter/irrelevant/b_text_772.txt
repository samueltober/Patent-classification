 CNA The invention discloses a power backflow control method of a photovoltaic solidstate transformer under a lowvoltage ridethrough condition belongs to a photovoltaic power generation technology in the field of electrical engineering and aims to avoid active power backflow when a power grid falls asymmetrically under the lowvoltage ridethrough condition Therefore the threephase cascaded photovoltaic solidstate transformer can still operate normally in the lowvoltage ride through process The method mainly comprises the steps of common directcurrent bus voltage control positivesequence active reference current and positivesequence reactive reference current selection power grid current control active power backflow control Hbridge converter directcurrent bus capacitor voltage control and maximum power point tracking control of a photovoltaic array Compared with the prior art even if the illumination intensity is low the problem of active power backflow can be effectively solved so that the system can still operate normally under the condition of low voltage ride through In addition the proposed control method can ensure that the active power of threephase transmission is almost the same
