 CNA The invention discloses an accurate investment index theory and calculation method based on a highelasticity power grid The method comprises the following steps S defining and dividing investmentof the highelasticity power grid s determining an evaluation dimension and a key characteristic quantity of a power grid investment index s in combination with the index system in the step Scollecting and calculating state data of the current power grid to obtain key characteristic quantity data s carrying out dimensionless processing on the key characteristic quantity data in the step S s determining the correlation degree between the key characteristic quantity data and the highelasticity power grid precise investment division through a matter element extension analysis method s calculating a power grid investment index and evaluating the overall investment condition of the power grid according to the index according to the invention the safety and reliability conditions of the power grid can be judged through the investment indexes power grid planning is converted into multitarget planning from singletarget dialogue the load coordination capacity of theuser side is fully considered and the reliability and inclusiveness of power grid planning are improved in combination with the sourceload interaction indexes
