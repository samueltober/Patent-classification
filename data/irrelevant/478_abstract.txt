The utility model discloses a threephase to singlephase power electronic converter system On the basis of a traditional threephasesinglephase power electronic converter an isolation switch group is added the risk that rearend equipment is damaged due to faults of a threephase threelevel rectifier to cause output instability of a traction network is reduced the robustness of a singlephase threelevel cascaded inverter is improved and stable output of the traction network is guaranteed during fault tolerance the problems of override jump of a switching pulse sequence SSi and unbalanced charging and discharging time of a direct current capacitor in a direct current link are fully considered faulttolerant operation after a system fault is realized by utilizing charging and discharging of a directcurrent capacitor to the greatest extent according to the utility model the reliability of system operation is enhanced the stability range of the system after fault toleranceis broadened even if an extremely severe fault state occurs ie after the threephase threelevel rectifier of a certain module completely quits operation due to a fault the normal and stable operation of the system can still be ensured and the network voltage of the traction network is not influenced by the fault
