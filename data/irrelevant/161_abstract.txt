In a power conversion device an inverter  of each of three arms A to A is controlled such that circulating current Iz of three arms A to A follows a reference Izrt in a test period times t to t in which a power system  is cut off from the three arms A to A and whether the power conversion device is normal is determined based on circulating current Iz in the test period Whether the power conversion device is normal therefore can be determined without affecting the power system
