 CNB The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle chassis and discloses a vehicle steeringrolling linkage device and an active rolling vehicle The vehicle steeringrolling linkage device is formed through linkage of rolling mechanisms and a steering mechanism each rolling mechanism comprises a vehicle body a lower pull rod a steering knuckle main spindle an upper pull rod a shock absorber a rocker a steering knuckle wheels a supporting rod and a driving rod and the steering mechanism is in a steering trapezoid shape formed by a connecting rod left and right steering arms and the vehicle body The rolling mechanisms and the steering mechanism share the same vehicle body and linkage is achieved through left and right balance levers via a spherical hinge through vehiclesteering and vehicle body rolling twodegreeoffreedom movement it is achieved that vehicle steering and vehicle body rolling are separately controlled In the vehicle driving process three workingconditions of steering rolling separate rolling and separate steering can be achieved the linkage device is used for active vehicle body rolling during vehicle steering so that when the vehicle turns off or passes through a slope road the vehicle automatically tilts a certain angle to resist centrifugal force or rollover force and a stable driving attitude is kept
