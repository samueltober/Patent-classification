 CNA The invention provides an automobile semiactive suspension damping control method An acquisition module a conversion module a processing module and a control module are included The control method comprises the following steps of S collecting the current sprung mass through a sensor S collecting automobile speed information through a sensor S respectively inputting the information into an AD conversion module S inputting the converted digital information into a control module S analyzing and outputting a control signal U by the control module and S inputting the control signal U into a DA conversion module and outputting control voltage to adjust suspension damping The semiactive suspension damping control method has the advantages that a multipoint measurement mode is adopted sprung mass and vehicle body speed information are collected damping of the semiactive suspension is changed through a fuzzy control algorithm in the controller and the comfort and safety of the suspension are effectively improved
