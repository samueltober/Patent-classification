 EPA Two inverters provided at respective both ends of openend windings are appropriately controlled A rotating electrical machine control device  that can control a first inverter  and a second inverter  by a plurality of control schemes respectively the control schemes differing from each other in at least one of a switching pattern and a switching frequency and being independent of each other has a control mode in which the first inverter  and the second inverter  are controlled by the same control scheme in a first speed region VR in which the rotational speed of a rotating electrical machine  and the first inverter  and the second inverter  are controlled by different control schemes in a second speed region VR in which the rotational speed of the rotating electrical machine  is higher than in the first speed region VR
