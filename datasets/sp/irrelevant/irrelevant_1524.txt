 CNB The invention discloses a transportation robot Under the control of an electric control module torque output by a steering assembly is transmitted to an inner shaft sleeve the inner shaft sleeve transmits the torque to a sliding column a driving wheel is driven by the sliding column to steer and therefore independent steering control over all wheels is achieved and steering is flexible each driving wheel is provided with an independent suspension mechanism the suspension mechanisms are located over the driving wheels so that the effective action distance of the suspension mechanismsis increased and the lateral rigidity is good the load state and the speed are designed in a matched mode so that it is guaranteed that the robot can rapidly run in a noload state and good obstacle crossing capacity is achieved when the robot is in full load the robot operates at a low speed and all the driving wheels have good ground attaching performance so that the suspension phenomenon is avoided it is ensured that the robot has sufficient power performance and the robot has good stability and accurate positioning performance when the robot is in full load
