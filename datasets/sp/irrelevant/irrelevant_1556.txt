 CNB The invention provides a selfenergized magnetorheological shock absorber for a hub motor driven electric vehicle and belongs to the field of vehicle system shock absorption The selfenergized magnetorheological shock absorber is composed of a magnetorheological shock absorber and a linear electromagnetic dynamic vibration absorber which are in rigid connection is easy to control small in energy consumption and is used for restraining vehicle body vibration and improving taking comfort of the hub motor driven electric vehicle the linear electromagnetic dynamic vibration absorber comprises a stator and a rotor and always works in a passive energy feedback mode the linear electromagnetic dynamic vibration absorber is a massrigiditydamping resonance system acting on wheels doesnot need external control so that vehicle body acceleration tire dynamic load and suspension dynamic deflection in the resonance frequency band of the wheels are effectively reduced vibration of the wheels is restrained and driving safety of the hub motor driven electric vehicle is improved When the stator and the rotor perform relative linear motion a coil winding generates induction current to provide energy for the magnetorheological shock absorber to realize selfenergization of the shock absorber and meanwhile residual energy is stored in the storage battery to realize energy recovery
