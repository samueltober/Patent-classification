 EPB A vibration damper support or suspension strut support for a motor vehicle wheel suspension According to the invention a suspension strut support or vibration damper support is formed by an upper supporting bearing  of a vehicle wheel suspension which at last supports a piston rod  of a vibration damper on a support point of a vehicle body  for which purpose the piston rod  is connected to a supporting bearing body  and the latter is connected to the motor vehicle body  wherein the supporting bearing  comprises a device  for dissipating kinetic energy which when forces occur which without said device would cause deformation of the vehicle body  permits a relative movement between vehicle body  and supporting bearing body  and in the process dissipates kinetic energy wherein the device  for dissipating kinetic energy is placed between supporting bearing body  and vehicle body
