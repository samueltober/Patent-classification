 CNB     Provide a power amplifier for amplifying radio frequency signals The power amplifier may include an envelope tracking power supply a carrier amplifier coupled to the envelope tracking power supply an input matching network configured to separate the amplified radio frequency signal from the carrier amplifier and a peak amplifier The envelope tracking power supply is coupled and configured to amplify the part of the amplified radio frequency signal from the input matching network an impedance converter configured to respond to the amplified signal from the input matching network The other part of the radio frequency signal performs impedance transformation an output matching network configured to combine the outputs of the peak amplifier and impedance converter With the claimed solution a more powerful and efficient power amplifier that can operate over a wider frequency range can be realized
