In the MMC type power converter the control device calculates an evaluation value indicating the degree of voltage variation of the power storage element of each converter cell When this evaluation value exceeds the threshold value YES in S the control device i when a positive current is flowing through the first converter cell in which the voltage of the power storage element is larger than the average value To reduce the positive voltage output time S ii increase the positive voltage output time when a negative current is flowing through the first converter cell S iii power storage element Increase the output time of the positive voltage when a positive current is flowing in the second transducer cell where the voltage of is smaller than the average value S or iv in the negative direction to the second transducer cell The plurality of converter cells are controlled so that at least one of reducing the output time of the positive voltage S is realized when the current is flowing
