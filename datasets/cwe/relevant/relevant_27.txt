 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device for a wheel capable of alleviating sudden slip generated between a caulking part and a shoulder part of an outer joint member for preventing generation of stick slip sound  SOLUTION The outer joint member  is connected to a hub ring  with an inner wheel  fixed thereto by the caulking part  so as to transmit torque via serration and to be attachabledetachable in the axial direction In this bearing device for a wheel a cap  is interposed between the caulking part  and the shoulder part  the cap  is formed by pressing a steel plate having corrosion resistance and its surface roughness is set to be Ra  or less A locking part c extending radially inward is integrally formed on an outer diameter part the inner diameter is set to be slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the caulking part  and the cap  is mounted to the caulking part  by elastically deforming the locking part c which reduces the friction coefficient and alleviates the sudden slip so as to prevent generation of the stick slip sound  COPYRIGHT CJPOINPIT
