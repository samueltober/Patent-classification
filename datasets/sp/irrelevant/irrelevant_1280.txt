 CNA The invention relates to a load carrying AGV and a damping mechanism applied to a steering wheel The damping mechanism comprises a mounting bracket and a damping assembly the mounting bracket comprises a mounting plate and mounting lugs the mounting lugs are hinged to a main supporting frame through hinge assemblies the damping assembly comprises a damping pipe a damping spring and a spring ejector block the damping pipe is arranged above the mounting plate the damping spring is arranged in the damping pipe the spring ejector block is arranged at one end of the damping pipe and abuts against the damping spring and the end extending out of the damping pipe of the spring ejector block is used for abutting against the main supporting frame When the damping mechanism runs to the ground which protrudes upwards or sinks downwards the steering wheel assembly is lifted or swings downwards the damping spring is compressed or lengthened the damping spring forms torque with the hinge assemblies as the base point and the torque enables force applied to the mounting plate by the damping spring to be balanced with force applied to the steering wheel assembly by the ground The damping amplitude is more obvious the damping mechanism is more suitable for the condition of large gradient and the whole damping mechanism is more flexible
