 CNA The invention discloses an automobile active suspension control method based on a parameter realtime adjustable PID Proportion Integration Differentiation controller which specifically comprises the following steps of establishing a whole automobile dynamic model in carsim establishing various simulation working conditions for testing automobile driving performance and setting input and output variables relative to simulink firstly enabling a carsim to output a simulation result of an automobile under the current working condition to a PID controller with realtime adjustable parameters enabling the PID controller to determine the damping force of a shock absorber according to a certain control logic and transmit the damping force back to the carsim through simulink and enabling the carsim to calculate all indexes of the automobile again and output the indexes to the simulink judging whether each index is in an expected range or not by the simulink and if a certain index is not in the expected range adjusting the damping force of the shock absorber by the PID controller and inputting the damping force to the carsim again until all indexes simulated by carsim are in an expected range According to the method a carsim andmatlabsimulink joint simulation mode is adopted a unified simulink simulation framework is adopted multiscene and multitarget control of the vehicle is carried out and a remarkable control effect is achieved
