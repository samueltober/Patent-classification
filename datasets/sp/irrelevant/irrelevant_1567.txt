 CNA The invention discloses an automobile suspension damping system and relates to the technical field of automobile accessories The automobile suspension damping system comprises a cylinder body wherein a piston is slidably connected in the cylinder body and an upper cavity and a lower cavity are formed between the top of the piston and the cylinder body and between the bottom of the piston and the cylinder body correspondingly A protection barrel fixedly connected with a piston rod is arranged on the outer side of the cylinder body when the piston rod slides in the cylinder body the piston rod drives the protection barrel to slide on the outer side of the cylinder body limiting blocks extending into the cylinder body are fixedly arranged at the two ends of the bottom of the inner side of the protection barrel correspondingly and limiting grooves matched with the limiting blocks are formed in the two ends of the outer side of the cylinder body correspondingly so that when the protection barrel stretches out and draws back along with the piston rod the protection barrel can be quite well attached to the outer wall of the cylinder body the piston rod is well protected in anallaround mode when the piston rod stretches out of the cylinder body and the problem that external impurities adhere to the piston rod and thus the service life of the piston rod is shortened is solved effectively
