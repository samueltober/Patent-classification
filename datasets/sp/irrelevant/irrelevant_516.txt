 KRA The present invention relates to coupling rods   for a wheel suspension which comprises a middle section  connecting two end unit areas   individually having eyes for assembly   for accommodating a bearing  or a joint Here at least the individual end unit areas   are reinforced by a plurality of ribs   vertically extended against an external side surface a of the coupling rods   In this case in the individual end unit areas   two external ribs  and one or more internal ribs  between the two external ribs  are put individually being vertical against an individual shaft  of the eyes for assembly   placed on a plane apart in the direction of the shaft Thus an extension unit Ra of the two external ribs  vertical against the external side surface a is greater than an extension unit Ri of the one or more internal ribs  vertical against the external side surface a The present invention aims to manufacture a coupling rod which has high load accommodation ability when the weight is low
