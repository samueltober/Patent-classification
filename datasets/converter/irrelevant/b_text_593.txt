 CNA The invention discloses a converter station and system built by combining an offshore wind power booster station and a flexible direct current converter valve The converter station comprises a flexible direct current transformer a flexible direct current converter valve group and a valve group bypass switch the output ends of a plurality of wind power plants are gathered in a confluence bus aprimary side of the flexible directcurrent transformer is used for being connected into a confluence bus a secondary side of the flexible directcurrent transformer is connected with the input end of the flexible directcurrent converter valve group a valve set bypass switch is connected beside an output end of the flexible directcurrent converter valve group concentrated converter stations are designed into the booster station in a distributed mode limitation of difficulty in transportation construction operation and maintenance of largescale offshore converter stations on offshore wind power output voltage levels and capacities is avoided one wind power plant corresponds to one coconstruction converter station and when the wind power plant breaks down a bypass switch is switched on in a mode of outputting zero voltage through a flexible direct current converter valve The method achieves the removal of a fault side does not affect the power transmission of other wind power plants improves the power transmission capability of an offshore wind power plant and improves the power transmission reliability modularization and standardization
