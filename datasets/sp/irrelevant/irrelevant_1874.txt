 CNA     The invention discloses a torsion beam suspension and a method for automatically adjusting the angle of its spring disk The torsion beam suspension includes a beam Both ends of the beam are fixed with longitudinal arms Both ends of the beam are also fixed with an angle adjustment mechanism The output end of the angle adjustment mechanism is fixed with a spring plate assembly The angle adjustment mechanism can rotate the spring plate assembly  To keep the spring support surface of the spring disk assembly parallel to the body spring seat to realize the automatic adjustment method of the spring disk angle of the torsion beam suspension the suspension position information is measured in real time through the body height sensor and transmitted to the vehicle ECU for calculation The inclination angle of the spring disk relative to the body spring seat is realtime and then the vehicle ECU controls the angle adjustment mechanism to rotate the spring disk assembly so that the spring disk and the body spring seat are always parallel and opposed So that the coil spring is always in the best clamping state has a better shock absorption effect and can effectively avoid the problems of the coil spring from falling out rotating and abnormal noise
