 CNU     The utility model discloses a drive axle wheel hub bearing locking structure and a vehicle and belongs to the technical field of vehicles The driving axle hub bearing locking structure of the utility model includes an inner bearing a spacer sleeve an outer bearing a gasket assembly a ring gear bracket and a locking part which are sequentially sleeved on the shaft head and arranged coaxially with the shaft head The gasket assembly abuts on the outer bearing and the shaft head at the same time so that the axial pressure provided by the locking element not only acts on the end surface of the outer bearing but also acts on the shaft head which facilitates the improvement of the tightening torque of the locking element and uses the gasket at the same time The sheet assembly adjusts the pretightening force between the inner bearing and the outer bearing and uses the spacer to compress the inner bearing and the outer bearing to avoid loosening of the inner bearing and the outer bearing thereby avoiding the problems of wear and oil leakage of the gasket assembly The vehicle of the utility model reduces the maintenance frequency of the vehicle by applying the abovementioned drive axle wheel hub bearing locking structure
