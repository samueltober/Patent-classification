The invention provides a power supply network voltage comprehensive compensation control method based on a threephase chain power electronic converter which is controlled by a random load current detection module a power supply network voltage change closedloop control module and a power supply network access point reactive power closedloop control Module implementation The random load current detection module calculates the harmonic current component the reactive current component and the current component that cause voltage flicker injected into the grid by the load and the output value of the power supply network voltage change control module and the reactive power of the power supply network access point The output value of the closedloop control module is superimposed on the calculation of the reactive current component Finally the harmonic current component the reactive current component and the current component that cause voltage flicker injected by the load into the grid are added together and output as the total current reference value In the converter current control module the purpose of compensating the voltage of the power supply network is achieved The power quality problems caused by the load will be effectively controlled
