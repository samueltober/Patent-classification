 CNB The invention discloses an electronic controlled suspension and ABS coordinated control device A control cylinder is arranged on the right side of a controlled piston rod of an active suspension system a sealing block is arranged between the control cylinder and an electromagnet the control cylinder is in communication with a first interface of an electromagnetic valve via an oil pipe in a sealed manner a second interface of the electromagnetic valve is in communication with a brake wheel cylinder of an ABS system in a sealed manner a third interface of the electromagnetic valve is in communication with a brake liquid storage tank of the ABS system in a sealed manner the on and off of the electromagnetic valve are controlled by three parallel relays the on and off of control circuits of the three relays are respectively controlled by a normal open valve a normal closed valve and a hydraulic pump of the ABS system when the electromagnetic valve is in an offposition the firstinterface and the third interface are in communication with each other and when the electromagnetic valve is in an onposition the first interface and the second interface are in communication witheach other According to the electronic controlled suspension and ABS coordinated control device in the process that the ABS system takes effect the head pressing displacement value and the tail lifting displacement value can be prevented from changing with the changing of the brake force so that passengers in a vehicle may feel more comfortable
