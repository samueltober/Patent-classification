The invention provides a mine fuze value changing circuit used for detecting signals transmitted by the hunting mine sonar Multiple highfrequency stripshaped hydrophones are arranged in the circular truncated cone space to form the hydrophone array and the requirement for receiving incident active sonar signals in the circumferential direction is met each stripshaped hydrophone is provided with a signal conditioning circuit which independently controls poweron work the signal conditioning circuit of each channel adopts a timesharing poweron working mode and is combined with the hydrophone array to form a timesharing scanning wave beam and the energy consumption is reduced while the circumferential wave beam covering function is met a hydrophone signal is conditioned and then enters a normallyelectrified part formed by a multichannel comparator and a singlechip microcomputer circuit and the comparator compares the voltage of the signal with a preset reference threshold value in addition the signal conditioning circuit and the multichannel comparator are completed by the analog circuit the analog circuit can realize lower energy consumption and the signal conditioning circuit adopts a multichannel timesharing poweron working mode so that the power consumption of the system is further reduced
