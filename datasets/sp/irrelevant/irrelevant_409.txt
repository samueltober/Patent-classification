 CNB The invention provides a quasizero stiffness vibration isolation system and a vehicle The quasizero stiffness vibration isolation system involves negative stiffness devices an air spring and gearrack mechanisms one end of the air spring is connected with a vehicle body and the other end of the air spring is connected with a chassis frame the negative stiffness devices are symmetrically distributed with respect to the central axis of the air spring one ends of the negative stiffness devices are connected with the gear rack mechanisms and the other ends of the negative stiffness devices are used for being connected with the chassis frame and racks of the gear rack mechanisms are used for being connected with the vehicle body and gears are used for being connected with the chassisframe The quasizero stiffness vibration isolation system can be applied to the field of automotive suspensions the vehicle body is in a partial shaking range the overall rigidity is reduced theinherent frequency is reduced and the smoothness of the whole vehicle is improved and when the shaking amount of the vehicle body is too large namely when the amplitude of the vehicle body is large the gears are not meshed with the racks and the negative stiffness devices stop working so that instability caused by the negative stiffness devices is avoided The system is simple in overall structure and more energysaving
