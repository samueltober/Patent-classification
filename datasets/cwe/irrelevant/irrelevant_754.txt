 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To realize a structure of a hub unit bearing capable of suppressing the amount of magnetic flux flowing to the side of a suppressing portion among the magnetic flux emitted from a detected portion of an encoder and accurately supporting and fixing the encoder to an inner ring     SOLUTION A core metal  of an encoder  has a cap fitting cylinder portion  outerly fitted to an axially inner end portion of an inner ring  and a cap fitting cylinder portion  in the radial direction from the axially outer end portion An outward flange portion  that is bent outward a step plate portion  that is bent inward in the radial direction from the axially inner end of the cap fitting cylinder portion  and has a pressed surface  on the axial inner side surface and a step plate portion The connecting plate portion  that is bent inward in the axial direction from the radial inner end of  and the connecting plate portion  that is bent inward in the radial direction from the axially inner end of the connecting plate portion  and is axially more than the caulking portion  that is the holding portion It has a support plate portion  arranged inside The encoder main body  is supported and fixed to the inner side surface in the axial direction of the support plate portion  and has the detected portion  on the inner side surface in the axial direction
