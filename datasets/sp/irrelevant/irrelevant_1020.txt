 CNA The invention discloses a mobile platform The invention discloses a mobile platform The mobile platform comprises a vehicle frame and four driving assemblies located at the four corners of the vehicle frame the two driving assemblies located at one end of the vehicle frame form a pair the two driving assemblies located at the other end of the vehicle frame form the other pair each driving assembly comprises a driving motor a suspension mechanism a universal coupling and a wheel According to the mobile platform of the invention the four independent driving wheels are provided with thesuspension mechanisms so that the four driving wheels can be kept to touch the ground when the ground is bumpy so that enough driving force is provided the driving motors are located in the vehicleframe and drive the wheels through the universal couplings and the highest points of the wheels are lower than the lower end face of the vehicle frame In this way compared with the technical scheme that a hub motor is adopted the waterproof requirement of a circuit part of the driving motors which drive the wheels through the universal coupling is greatly lowered
