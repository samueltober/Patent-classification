 CNB The invention discloses an active suspension planetary rover wheel lifting walking control method and system According to the method and system an included angle adjustment mechanism is controlled to move so as to carry out reasonable adjustment on the mass center position of a planetary rover system and therefore it can be guaranteed that a planetary rover can lift a target wheel and that the whole rover is stable after the wheel is lifted the main and auxiliary rocker arms of the planetary rover are locked through a clutch mechanism so that the main and auxiliary rocker arms cannot rotate relatively the included angle adjusting mechanism is controlled to move so that the target wheel is lifted and the relative movement angle of the included angle adjusting mechanism is determined by the lifting height of the wheel and other driving mechanisms which do not lift wheels of the planetary rover are controlled to move and the walking of the planetary rover after the wheels arelifted can be achieved
