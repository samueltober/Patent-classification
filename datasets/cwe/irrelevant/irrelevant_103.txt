 CNU The noise reduction hub is characterized in that more than one Helmholtz silencer is arranged on the circumferential surface of the hub each Helmholtz silencer comprises a resonant cavity and an airguide pipe and an inner cavity formed by the hub and a tire is communicated with the air guide pipes According to the utility model the Helmholtz noise elimination principle is applied the deviceconsists of a resonant cavity and an air guide pipe when incident sound waves generated by the tire reach the resonant cavity one part of the incident sound waves are reflected back the other partof the incident sound waves are divided into two branches one branch enters the resonant cavity or pushes air in the resonant cavity to move the other branch continues to be propagated in the air guide pipe to form transmission waves and the purpose of noise elimination is achieved due to the fact that acoustic impedance at the junction of pipelines changes
