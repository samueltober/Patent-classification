 CNU The vector tangent wheel damping assembly comprises an assembly support a positioning support is arranged on the outer surface of the upper end of the assembly support a fixing screw is arranged onthe inner wall of the positioning support an arcshaped plate is fixedly connected to the front end of the assembly support and a positioning clamping groove is formed in the arcshaped plate A wheel frame is arranged on the inner side of the assembly support wheels are fixedly connected to the outer wall of the wheel frame and damping springs are arranged between the positioning supports andthe arcshaped plates According to the vector tangent wheel damping assembly the outer surface of the lower end of the damping spring makes contact with the outer surface of the upper end of the arcshaped plate in a tangent mode better damping operation can be conveniently carried out the structure is simpler and more convenient the operation performance is excellent and the practicabilityis high The fixing screw rod penetrates through the positions of the positioning support and the positioning clamping groove and is fixedly connected with the interiors of the positioning support and the arcshaped plate through fixing bolts bolts do not need to be used at the bottom and connection is more attractive
