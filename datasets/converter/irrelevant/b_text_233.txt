 EPA A DC voltage coordination control method is applied to a multiterminal VSCHVDC power transmission system or a VSCHVDC power grid system When a lowerlevel control is used in the active power control mode the active power reference value of the converter is generated according to the converter DC voltage and the converter DC voltage active power curve it also includes an upperlevel control to adjust the control mode and active power setting value of the lowerlevel control to ensure the steadystate performance of the system This method has low dependence on communication avoids the problem that the fixed slope and margin cannot meet all operating conditions and is suitable for largescale VSCHVDC systems and has scalability
