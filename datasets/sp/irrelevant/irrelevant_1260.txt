 CNA The invention provides a trailer lifting axle automatic control system The system comprises a height sensor which collects the height of a trailer airbag in a vertical direction and obtains the height information of a trailer body a trailer electronic braking system continuously collects trailer loads obtains trailer load data processes the load data and then sends a control instruction an air suspension electromagnetic valve is connected with an air source and is respectively connected with the height sensor and the trailer electronic braking system the air suspension electromagneticvalve receives a control instruction sent by the trailer electronic braking system Inflation or deflation of the trailer air bag is controlled therefore the trailer lifting axle ascends or descends according to the realtime load data of the trailer air spring the trailer lifting axle is automatically controlled to ascend and descend so that the mode that the trailer lifting axle is manuallycontrolled to ascend or descend is replaced automatic ascending and descending of the lifting axle are achieved the lifting axle control process is more intelligent oil consumption is reduced andlosses of trailer tires in a nonfullload state are reduced
