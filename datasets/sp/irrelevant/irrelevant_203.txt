 DEB     Damper bearing  comprisinga bearing housing  for attachment to a motor vehiclea disc  for attachment to a piston rod  of a vibration damper  andan elastomer body  made of a microcellular elastomer which is clamped in the bearing housing  and receives the disc  in order to elastically support it in the bearing housing wherein the disc  consists of a material that has a higher rigidity than the material of the elastomer body wherein between the disc  and the elastomer body  a modifier  in the form of a casing  of a radially outer portion  of the disc  is arranged which consists of a material that is opposite the material of the elastomer body  has a higher rigidity andwherein the elastomer body  is ringshaped and in the noninstalled state but with an embedded disk  has two opposite end faces   which are flatcharacterized in thatthe thickness of the sheathing  varies in the circumferential direction of the disk  so that the material of the elastomer body  is compressed more and less
