 JPA To realize a structure capable of sufficiently securing sealability for a long periodSOLUTION A rotary opposite surface  provided on a slinger  and a stationary opposite surface  provided on a labyrinth slip  are made closely face each other thereby forming a labyrinth seal  between the rotary opposite surface  and the stationary opposite surface  The labyrinth slip  elastically deforms in a direction in which the distance between the stationary opposite surface  and the rotary opposite surface  decreases with the rotation of a hubSELECTED DRAWING Figure
