 CNU The hightemperatureresistant rubber wheel for the grill comprises a hub part and a tire part the tire part comprises a heatresistant layer and a metal layer the heatresistant layer is wrapped bythe metal layer the hub part is wrapped by the metal layer the metal layer is composed of metal wires and the metal wires are embedded and fixed into the outer side of the hub part The metal layer is additionally arranged outside the heatresisting layer the metal layer is used for isolating charcoal and preventing the charcoal from making contact with the heatresisting layer and burning out the heatresisting layer and meanwhile the metal layer wraps the metal layer so that the rubber wheel has excellent abrasion resistance and is not prone to abrasion compared with rubber
