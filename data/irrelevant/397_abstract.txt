In this power conversion device of an MMC type a control device  generates first voltage command values Vupref Vunref which are not based on a circulation current Iccu circulating among a plurality of leg circuits  and a second voltage command value Vccuref which is based on the circulation current Iccu for each of the leg circuits A plurality of individual controllers  are provided corresponding to a plurality of respective converter cells  and generate a gate control signal Ga for controlling the switching of a switching element a of the corresponding converter cell on the basis of the first voltage command values and the second voltage command value When generating the gate control signal by using a pulse width modulation the individual controllers each modulate a carrier signal CS with the second voltage command value so that the pulse width of the gate control signal varies in accordance with the second voltage command value
