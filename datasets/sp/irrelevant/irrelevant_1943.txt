 CNA     The invention relates to a hydraulic active suspension flow control system which includes a hydraulic oil tank a variable pump connected with an oil suction port and the hydraulic oil tank and a check valve a servo valve and a suspension cylinder controlled by the servo valve which are sequentially connected to the oil outlet of the variable pump The variable pump is connected to the engine through a clutch an accumulator is connected between the servo valve and the oneway valve it also includes an oil pressure sensor an engine speed sensor a vehicle speed sensor and a flow rate that controls the displacement of the variable pump installed at the outlet of the accumulator Controller The flow controller performs closedloop control of the output pressure and flow of the active suspension hydraulic system according to the accumulator outlet pressure vehicle speed and engine speed so that the accumulator outlet pressure remains basically stable and the output flow of the variable pump is the same as that required by the active suspension system The flow is basically the same this system can make the active suspension system operate stably and continuously through closedloop control reduce the power consumption of the active suspension system on the engine and make reasonable use of the engine power
