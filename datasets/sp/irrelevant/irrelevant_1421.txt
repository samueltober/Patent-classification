 CNA The invention relates to an automobile bridge with an automobile body shock absorber absorbing side impact energy The automobile bridge comprises an axle housing a front axle an automobile frame and two longitudinal bumpers distributed on two sides of the automobile frame and a half axle penetrates through the axle housing the automobile frame comprises a front cross beam and a rear cross beam the two ends of the front beam are supported at the two ends of the front axle through dampers respectively and the two ends of the rear beam are supported at the two ends of the axle housing through dampers respectively The front ends of the longitudinal bumpers are connected with the front cross beam through front axle part side impact energy eliminating devices and the rear ends of the longitudinal bumpers are connected with the rear cross beam through axle housing part side impact energy eliminating devices The automobile bridge has the advantages that side impact energy can be absorbed without crumpling deformation of the automobile frame when side impact occurs and the shock absorber supporting the automobile frame participates in energy absorption so that the problem of poor safety caused by the fact that an automobile body needs to crumple to absorb energy during side impact of an existing automobile is solved
