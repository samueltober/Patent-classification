 CNU     The utility model belongs to the technical field of robot precision equipment in particular to a chassis suspension mechanism and a walking motion system The chassis suspension mechanism includes a bracket the bracket includes a first connecting plate and a second connecting plate the first connecting plate and the second connecting plate are connected in an L shape the first connecting plate is provided with a first connecting seat and the second connecting plate A second connecting seat is provided a shock absorber assembly the first connecting end of the shock absorber assembly is connected to the first connecting seat a swing arm assembly the third connecting end of the swing arm assembly is connected to the second connecting seat and the shock absorber The second connecting end of the assembly and the fourth connecting end of the swing arm assembly are both used for rotatably connecting with the connecting side wall of the wheel the central axis of the shock absorber is arranged obliquely away from the second connecting plate The application of this technical solution solves the problem that the existing suspension mechanism cannot effectively dampen the lateral vibration caused by the axial force which causes the side deviation of the robot during walking
