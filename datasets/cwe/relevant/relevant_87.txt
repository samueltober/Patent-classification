 EPB A method for manufacturing a rolling bearing unit is provided to periodically reciprocate a stage  in a vertical direction by rotating and driving a servo motor  while rotating a roll about a central axis of a hub main body using a roll driving motor  in a state in which a processing surface of the roll is pressed against other end surface of a caulking section in an axial direction A period of the reciprocation is restricted by a relation between a rotation position of the roll about the central axis of the hub main body and an engaged state between concave sections which are sections between a plurality of processed teeth formed in the processing surface of the roll and a face spline tooth formed by the concave section
