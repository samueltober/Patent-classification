 CNA A damper system for a vehicle is provided that includes an outer tube a piston rod and a piston assembly that is mounted to the piston rod and separates the outer tube into first and second workingchambers A valve assembly mounted to the piston assembly controls fluid flow between the first and second working chambers A magnetic rotor is fixed to and extends annularly about the outer tubeA stator assembly is coupled to the piston rod by a spherical bearing assembly The stator assembly includes a plurality of coils that apply an active damping force to the piston rod when energized The coils can also generate electricity from axial movements of the piston rod relative to the outer tube One or more glide bearings are disposed radially between the coils and the magnetic rotor in asliding fit to stabilize the stator assembly
