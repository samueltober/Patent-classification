 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of connecting pieces particularly relates to a connecting piece of a suspension beam rotating mechanism of a new energy automobile and provides the following scheme aiming at the problem that most of existing connecting pieces cannot adjust the distance between a first connecting seat and a second connecting seat so that the automobile suspensionbeam cannot meet different requirements when being screwed for connection The connecting device comprises a first connecting seat the outer side of the first connecting seat movably abuts against the inner side of a second connecting seat two through holes are formed in the top of the first connecting seat and the inner sides of the two through holes are movably provided with the outer side of a first pipe body and the outer side of a second pipe body correspondingly The suspension beam of the new energy automobile can meet different connecting requirements the steel wire rope is woundthrough the arranged rotating shaft and the arranged manual rotating shaft so that the first connecting seat gradually moves into the second connecting seat and the distance between the first connecting seat and the second connecting seat is adjusted
