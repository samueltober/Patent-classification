 GBA A wheel speed sensing system for a work vehicle having an engine  a transmission  a differential  and an axle defining a central longitudinal axis and coupled to the differential The wheel speed sensing system comprises wheel speed sensor assemblies  and includes a sensor target  fig  disposed at the axle and a sensor  for example a Hall effect sensor configured to transmit a sensor signal wherein the sensor is located adjacently to the sensor target The sensor target includes a plurality of step splines  fig  each having a top surface  and first and second planar sidewalls  The sidewalls of the step splines are aligned along a radius extending from the central longitudinal axis  such that the sides are undercut with respect to the top surface An intersection of each of the sidewalls with the top surface defines an edge forming a relatively sharp transition configured to be sensed by the sensor A chamfer at the intersection of the sidewalls and the top surface is also contemplated
