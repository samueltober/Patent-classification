 CNU     A heavyduty wheel hub bearing includes an inner flange and an outer flange A first raceway is arranged on the first inner ring along the circumferential direction The inner side of the outer flange and the first inner ring are spaced apart in the circumferential direction A rolling ball the rolling ball is located in the first raceway a second inner ring is arranged between the outside of the outer flange and the inner flange and a second raceway is arranged on the second inner ring in the circumferential direction A plurality of tapered rollers are arranged spaced apart from the second inner ring along the circumferential direction and the tapered rollers are located in the second raceway When the utility model is assembled the tapered roller and the second inner ring are pressed into the inner flange and then the outer flange and the rolling sphere are put on the pressfitted inner flange and the shaft is controlled by the first inner ring when the sleeve is assembled To the clearance can be The bearing capacity of the tapered roller is greater than that of the rolling sphere so that the fatigue failure time of the second raceway of the wheel hub bearing can be avoided earlier than the first raceway which prevents the bearing from being unusable due to abnormal noise and improves the product life
