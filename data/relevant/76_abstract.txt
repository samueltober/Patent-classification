The invention discloses a power electronic transformer based on a stepdown ACDC and an intermediate frequency isolation type DCDC A stepdown ACDC converter and an intermediate frequency isolation type DCDC converter are connected through a DC port And the number of submodules of the stepdown ACDC converter and the intermediate frequency isolated DCDC converter are decoupled The invention uses a stepdown ACDC converter with decoupling of the number of submodules and an intermediate frequency isolated DCDC converter to construct a power electronic transformer and the stepdown ACDC converter introduces the topology of the power electronic transformer In the power electronic transformer the voltage level of the first DC port in the power electronic transformer is reduced thereby reducing the number of submodules in the intermediate frequency isolated DCDC converter to achieve a compact design and significantly reduce the cost and volume of the system Improve power density and operating efficiency at the same time the power electronic transformer has multiple types of AC and DC ports which is convenient to realize the integrated energy management of the sourcegridloadstorage system
