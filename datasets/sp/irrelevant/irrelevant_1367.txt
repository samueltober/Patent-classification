 CNU The utility model discloses a suspension device a chassis device and selfmoving equipment The suspension device comprises a guide buffer mechanism and a damping mechanism The guide buffer mechanism is arranged between the suspension bracket and the chassis along the vertical direction the damping mechanism is connected with the guide buffer mechanism in series when the distance between the suspension support and the chassis changes the guide buffer mechanism provides buffer between the suspension support and the chassis and the damping mechanism provides damping in at least one changing direction By means of the guide buffer mechanism arranged in the vertical direction linear motion of the driving wheel set in the vertical direction during obstacle crossing can be limited bufferbetween the suspension support and the chassis can be provided and the damping mechanism is connected to the guide buffer mechanism in series so as to provide damping for the guide buffer mechanismwhen the guide buffer mechanism conducts buffer the guide buffer mechanism and the damping mechanism are simple in structure and are only connected in the vertical direction the occupied space of the structure is reduced and the obstacle crossing and damping effects can be improved
