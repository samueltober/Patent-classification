 CNU The utility model relates to a hub bearing unit with an inner flange plate without a shaft shoulder structure Inner flange plate the outer circle of one end of the inner flange plate is sleeved withan inner ring an outer flange plate is mounted at the root outside the inner flange plate a first annular channel is formed between the outer flange plate and the inner ring a second annular channel is formed between the inner circle of the outer flange plate and the outer circle of the inner flange plate a first steel ball retainer and a second steel ball retainer are installed in the firstannular channel and the second annular channel respectively a first steel ball and a second steel ball are installed on the first steel ball retainer and the second steel ball retainer respectivelyand a section gradual change area is arranged at the position matched with the inner ring of the outer circle face of the inner flange plate According to the hub bearing unit with the inner flangeplate without the shaft shoulder structure the section slowlychanging area is arranged at the matching position of the inner flange plate and the inner ring due to the fact that section changes aregentle the stress concentration effect in an original structure is eliminated and the strength and the bearing capacity of the inner flange plate are greatly improved
