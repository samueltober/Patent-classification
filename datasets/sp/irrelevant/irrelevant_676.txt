 CNB The invention discloses a gear and rack type semiactive energy feedback suspension actuator which comprises an actuator body an energy recovery circuit and an energy recovery control circuit and the actuator body comprises an actuator shell a brushless direct current motor a gear and rack unit a bidirectionaltounidirectional gear box and a damping spring unit the invention further discloses an energy recovery control method of the gear and rack type semiactive energy feedback suspension actuator By arranging the bidirectionaltounidirectional gear box bidirectional rotation of the gear and the rack can be converted into unidirectional rotation of the directcurrent brushless motor a large amount of inertia loss caused by repeated forward and reverse rotation of the directcurrent brushless motor is avoided the rotating speed of the directcurrent brushless motor is increased and therefore the energy feedback efficiency is improved due to the design of the energy recovery circuit and the energy recovery control method an energy feedback dead zone of a traditional energy feedback shock absorber is eliminated the energy recovery efficiency is improved the impact of drastic change of voltage on the vehiclemounted storage battery is reduced and the service life of the vehiclemounted storage battery is prolonged
