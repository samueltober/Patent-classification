 CNB The invention discloses a level shifter applied to a segmented driving circuit of a wide bandgap power device The level shifter comprises a level conversion module a digital logic processing moduleand an RS latch module A power rail conversion module converts signals of a lowvoltage area into signals of a highlevel voltage area through an LDMOS and signals of the highvoltage area are processed through a lowvoltage MOSFET the digital logic processing module is used for detecting the change of the signals at the output end of the power rail conversion module and quickly transmitting the signals to the RS latch module the RS latch module is used for stabilizing the output signal at a set level value so as to prevent misoperation caused by interference and in some embodiments an auxiliary pullup module for reducing the dynamic power consumption of the level shifter is arranged between the level conversion module and the digital logic processing module According to the invention the false triggering problem of the level shifter is solved through logic design the circuit response speed is improved and meanwhile the level shifter has the characteristics of zero static power consumption and low dynamic power consumption
