The invention discloses a device and method for converting double GMSL interface data into Cameralink interface data A first coaxial connector receives image data output by a first GSML digital camera and transmits the image data to a first GMSL interface chip and the first GMSL interface chip generates five differential signals according to the received image data and transmits the five differential signals to a LVDS switch chip A second coaxial connector receives image data output by a second GSML digital camera and transmits the image data to a second GMSL interface chip The second GMSLinterface chip generates five differential signals and transmits the five differential signals to the LVDS switch chip The LVDS switch chip outputs the five differential signals transmitted by the first GMSL interface chip or the second GMSL interface chip to a Cameralink connector according to a time sequence control signal fed back by a Cameralink connector The problem of conversion from theback of an industrial camera with a nontraditional interface to a universal camera interface is solved and subsequent acquisition processing and application are facilitated
