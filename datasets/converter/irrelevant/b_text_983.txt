 CNA     The present invention provides a BuckCLCL resonant converter cascaded DCDC power converter topology structure The CLCL topology structure replaces the halfbridge LLC structure in the existing BuckLLC converter and solves the problem The Buck circuit with lower efficiency is used for voltage regulation and LLC is limited to fixed frequency the efficiency is lower under heavy load and light load and the selection of K value for fixed frequency LLC design may cause ZVS loss and difficult parameter design technical problems  Especially when the duty ratio of the BUCK converter is fixed and the frequency of the CLCL converter is adjusted the system efficiency curve can be greatly improved under wide input conditions
