 CNU The utility model relates to an inclined retainer for retaining a plurality of balls forming an angular contact ball bearing and the angular contact ball bearing with the inclined retainer The innersurface of the pocket of the inclined retainer has an inner guide surface which is a concave curved surface constituting the other axial side of the radially inner side portion and an outer guide surface which is a concave curved surface constituting the one axial side of the radially outer side portion Furthermore portions of the inner surface of the pocket other than the inner guide surface and the outer guide surface are an inner receding surface and an outer receding surface which are located at positions receding from the rolling surface of the ball relative to the inner guide surfaceand the outer guide surface and the inner guide surface and the outer guide surface are separated by the inner receding surface and the outer receding surface According to this configuration it ispossible to provide a structure whereby lubricant adhering to the rolling surface of a ball can efficiently flow back between an outer ring raceway and an inner ring raceway even when the inner diameter of a pocket is brought close to the outer diameter of the ball
