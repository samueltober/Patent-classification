 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a protection cover having a high reliability sensor holder capable of preventing reduction in airtightness and reduction of strength of a partition wall between a magnetic sensor and a magnetic encoderSOLUTION This invention relates to a protection cover  press fitted into an outer ring so as to seal one end part of the bearing in an axial direction in airtight manner having a sensor holder part B holding a magnetic sensor A at a bearing device comprising a bearing having an inner ring and an outer ring and rollers rolling between the inner ring and the outer ring a magnetic encoder positioned at one end part in an axial direction of the bearing and fixed to the inner ring and a magnetic sensor A for detecting rotation of the magnetic encoder in opposition to a magnetic pole of the magnetic encoder A thick wall part  becoming a flow passage preferentially filling molten resin at a thin wall part forming a partition wall B at a cavity of a metallic mold is formed between a position corresponding to a gate of the metallic mold used for an injection molding to the partition wall B of a disclike member SELECTED DRAWING Figure
