 CNA The invention specifically relates to a taperedroller hub bearing and belongs to the technical field of bearings A bearing outer ring is nested on the upper surface of a bearing installation table and assembled with tapered rollers a roller retainer and a bearing inner ring so as to realize lowfriction rotating connection and the bearing inner ring is nested on the inner surface of a bearing rolling ring a bearing rotating shaft is rotationally embedded into the inner surface of a hub shaft so that the bearing rotating shaft rotates to drive the bearing inner ring to rotate a bearing installation and fixing disc and a bolt table are communicated through a bolt hole a threaded hole is in threaded fit with a fastening bolt the bearing installation and fixing disc can be conveniently installed and fixed and installation workers can conveniently install the bearing installation and fixing disc and the taper of the bearing inner ring is the same as that of the roller retainer so that the friction force of bearing rotation can be effectively reduced roller installation holes of the retainer are formed in the inner surface of the roller retainer in an annular array mode the tapered rollers can be effectively and conveniently fixed and then the rotation stability of the tapered rollers is kept
