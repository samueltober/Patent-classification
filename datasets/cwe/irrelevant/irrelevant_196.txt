 KRB     The present invention relates to a vehicle capable of driving in a tidal flat and more particularly to a vehicle for driving a tidal flat including a tidal running wheel having a rotatable blade The present invention is spaced along the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical body  that rotates along the rotation axis L the first wheel  with a plurality of blades  extending outward in the radial direction and the cylindrical body  In a vehicle for tidal driving including a wheel for a vehicle capable of driving tidal which includes a second wheel  coupled to one or both ends of the  the blades  are provided with a shaft  on the cylindrical body   the shaft  is rotated by a motor  the vehicle  is a vehicle based on the GPS module  and the location information received from the GPS module  Tidal flat driving judgment module  is installed to determine whether the position of the tidal flat is the same and the tidal running judgment module  determines the position of the vehicle  as the tidal flat By rotating  the blade  is positioned in a direction to push mud from the tidal flat When the position of the vehicle  is determined to be a general road the shaft  is rotated by the motor  so that the blade  is positioned to be horizontal to the driving direction to minimize air resistance Provide a driving vehicle
