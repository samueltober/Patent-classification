The invention relates to the technical field of unmanned aerial vehicles and particularly relates to an unmanned aerial vehicle homeward voyage monitoring method based on an intelligent lamp post anda control center When a flight electric quantity change curve is analyzed and the flight attitude is adjusted the residual electric quantity change data and the flight environment monitoring data can be considered at the same time time delay or adjustment deviation of flight attitude adjustment caused by only considering one of the residual electric quantity change data and the flight environment monitoring data is avoided It can be understood that the residual electric quantity change data is on the side of the tobemonitored unmanned aerial vehicle and the flight environment monitoring data is on the side of the target intelligent lamp post Realtime flight attitude adjustment can be performed based on the residual electric quantity change data and the flight environment monitoring data so that realtime and stable monitoring of homeward voyage monitoring of the unmanned aerial vehicle can be realized in combination with the environmental factors and the electric quantity loss safe homeward voyage of the unmanned aerial vehicle can be ensured and flight accidents can be avoided
