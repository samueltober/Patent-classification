 CNA The invention discloses a networked intelligent drivebywire chassis domain control device and a control method thereof The chassis comprises a chassis frame an electronic control active suspensionsystem an environment sensing system a driver information acquisition system a chassis domain controller four singlewheel controllers a standby wireless communication device a battery systema drivebywire driving device a drivebywire braking device and a drivebywire steering device According to the device through integration of the domain controller information interconnection and resource sharing can be achieved among scattered vehicle hardware in the domain of the drivebywire chassis function control is centralized in the domain controller to be processed and optimization of a data processing result is guaranteed Compared with a traditional distributed architecture a plurality of core function modules are integrated in the domain controller so that the requirement for a bottom ECU is reduced only a command of the domain controller needs to be executed the parts can be changed into standard parts through standardization of a data interaction interface anddevelopment cost is reduced
