 CNA The invention provides a directcurrent power mutual assistance method of a multicircuit extrahigh voltage directcurrent feedin alternatingcurrent system for a multicircuit extrahigh voltage directcurrent feedin alternatingcurrent power grid scene According to the method a constraint model of sending end and receiving end alternating current systems is constructed through sending end and receiving end alternating current side equivalent PQ node parameters obtained by Thevenin equivalent parameters of the sending end and receiving end alternating current systems and a quasisteadystate mathematical model under the multiconstraint condition the maximum value of the feedin active power of each DC line is optimally solved the adjustable capacity of the DC line is corrected according to the current DC operation state and the equivalent inertia of the sending end alternating current system of the DC line and accordingly the frequency current reference droop coefficient ofthe DC line is calculated and the direct current reference value of the DC line is adjusted The method gives full play to the effect of power mutual assistance among multiinfeed direct currentsand improves the power supporting capability so as to improve the stability level and robustness of the receivingend alternating current system
