 CNA     The present invention discloses a vehicle adjustment method and device wherein the vehicle adjustment method includes obtaining performance parameters of the vehicle in the current driving state determining the yaw rate error and error according to the yaw rate and ideal yaw rate of the vehicle Rate of change determine the active roll moment according to the yaw rate error error rate of change and fuzzy control rules distribute the active roll moment to each suspension thereby determining the main power of each suspension determine the main force of each suspension Ideal input force the weighted sum of the main power of each suspension and the ideal input force is used to determine the input of the active suspension system to the vehicle body the vehicle adjustment method calculates the active suspension separately from the angle of ride comfort and handling stability The active input force of the frame system and the weighted summation method take into account the two which improves the body attitude of the car while ensuring the yaw stability of the vehicle when turning
