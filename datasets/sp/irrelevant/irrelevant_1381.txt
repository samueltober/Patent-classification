 CNU The utility model discloses a trapezoid independent suspension system which comprises a trapezoid frame a shock absorber a spring and a chassis lifting system first fixing bearings are fixedly installed on the two sides of the bottom edge of the trapezoid frame and fixed to an automobile chassis through the first fixing bearings and hubs are fixedly connected to the sides away from the chassis of the trapezoid frame And a chassis lifting system is fixedly mounted on the automobile chassis between the two trapezoid frames and comprises a motor a lifting rotating shaft a second fixed bearing a screw rod a lifting gear and a lifting plate The trapezoidal independent suspension system is simple in structure adopts the horizontal springs realizes transverse transmission of road surface vibration does not directly transmit the vibration to the vehicle bottom and is better in vertical and longitudinal transmission vibration filtering effect large in transverse rigidity excellent in antiroll performance and good in safety compared with the traditional vertical springs Compared with a traditional independent suspension system which is provided with a plurality of movableparts the suspension system is firmer safer and stronger in transverse impact resistance
