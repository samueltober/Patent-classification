 EPA The disclosure relates to a rectifier having a mirror image leftright side topology Each side has a downconverter connected to half of a full bridge rectifier and is switched  degrees out of phase with the other side The sides of the full bridge rectifier have switches to rectify an alternating current signal into rectified signals and a first capacitor to store a first charge of a rectified signal Each of the downconverting circuits is connected to a first capacitor has a second capacitor to store a second charge of the rectified signal and switches to downconvert a voltage value of the first plus second charges to a direct current signal with a smaller voltage value A controller circuit switches the switches on and off at times that are asynchronous with times of sign changes of the AC signal to reduce harmonics at the input of the rectifier
