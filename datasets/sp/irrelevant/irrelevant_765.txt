 CNB The invention discloses an active suspension visual preview control method based on an improved fruit fly algorithm The active suspension visual preview control method comprises the following steps scanning a driving road surface in front of a vehicle  performing fractional order Fourier transform  performing image enhancement processing on the fractional Fourier transform spectrum performing data clustering determining the clustering number and separating each piece of clustering data  performing peak value position and peak value intensity statistics and least square method fitting on the separated clustering data to obtain flight time pulse width and amplitude  calculating the transverse displacement and the longitudinal displacement of the running vehicle  forming a characteristic matrix  inputting performance indexes of the passive suspension into a visual preview algorithm controller and  the visual preview algorithm controller adopting an improvedfruit fly algorithm to calculate the optimal active force The method is simple in step the most reasonable weighting coefficient matrix and weighting factor can be selected from pavements of different grades the optimal active force is provided for the active suspension and visual preview control over the vehicle active suspension is effectively achieved
