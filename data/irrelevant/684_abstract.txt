The invention discloses a motor motion controller based on BeagleBoneBlack belongs to the field of industrial robot multiaxis motion controllers and aims to solve problems that application occasions are limited due to the fact that an existing motor motion controller is large in size and control precision is affected due to the fact that errors of a pulse output mode are large The controllercomprises a BeagleBoneBlack single board computer an FPGA and a DSP the BeagleBoneBlack singleboard computer is used for issuing a motor motion path instruction and sending the motor motion pathinstruction to the FPGA the FPGA is used for receiving a motor motion path instruction issued by the BeagleBoneBlack single board computer and the motor motion path instruction is called by the DSP the FPGA is also used for further fine interpolation of the coarse interpolation motion path returned by the DSP the DSP is used for calling the motor motion path instruction from the FPGA performing coarse interpolation operation to form a coarse interpolation motion path and returning the coarse interpolation motion path to the FPGA and a final motor motion planning path is formed after twostage planning of rough interpolation and fine interpolation and is output to a motor driver in a pulse signal form
