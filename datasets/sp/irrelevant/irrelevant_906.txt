 DEA     The invention relates to a method for adapting the damping of a vehicle wheel suspension  with a vehicle wheel  an adjustable damper  and a control unit  The method provides that a steering angle set on the vehicle wheel  is recorded and transmitted to the control unit In a further method step damping is determined as a function of the steering angle wherein the damping in a first steering angle range is smaller than in a second steering angle range and wherein the first steering angle range comprises the range between   angular deviation compared to a straightahead position of the vehicle wheel up to a parking mode angle  and the second steering angle range extends from the parking mode angle  to   angular deviation from the straightahead position of the vehicle wheel  includes In a further method step the adjustable damper  is activated in order to adjust the damping determined thereon
