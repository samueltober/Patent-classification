The invention provides a directcurrent overvoltage control method and system of a hybrid cascaded directcurrent system The hybrid cascade direct current system comprises a rectification side and aninversion side the inversion side comprises a group of current source type converters and a group of voltage source type converters and the current source type converters and the voltage source type converters are connected in series The control method comprises during overvoltage of the hybrid cascaded directcurrent system generating a directcurrent overvoltage signal of the voltage source type converter and sending the directcurrent overvoltage signal to an inverter side current source type converter and a rectification side temporarily locking the control mode of the inverter sidecurrent source type converter into constant direct current voltage control on the basis of the direct current overvoltage signal of the voltage source type converter so as to avoid entering of a constant direct current control mode calculating a rectification side power reduction value based on the direct current overvoltage signal of the voltage source type converter reducing the rectification side DC power reference value by a rectification side power reduction value and when judging that the directcurrent overvoltage signal is eliminated recovering the rectificationside directcurrent power reference value to a normal value and releasing the temporary locking of the control mode of the inversionside current source type converter
