 CNU The utility model relates to a selfadaptive doublerow wheat wheel device for an AGV A first Mecanum wheel and a second Mecanum wheel are coaxially arranged on a wheel shaft the first Mecanum wheelis connected with the second Mecanum wheel and the wheel shaft is connected with a suspension bearing the two ends of the suspension are connected with guide rods through sliding ball bearings thelower ends of the guide rods are movably connected with the suspension the guide rods are sleeved with damping spiral springs one ends of the damping spiral springs abut against the suspension theother ends of the damping spiral springs abut against fixing bases and rubber damping mechanisms are further arranged on the suspension The utility model provides a structure capable of moving along the axial direction of a guide shaft and swinging along the axis connecting line of a sliding spherical bearing so that two Mecanum wheels are ensured to have adhesive force simultaneously on a severe road surface and the yawing phenomenon of the AGV is avoided
