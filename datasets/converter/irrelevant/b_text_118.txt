 CNA There is provided a converter scheme  comprising a plurality of converters   each converters   configurable to change between blocked and deblocked states each converters  having a configurable power level the converter scheme  further including a controller  programmed to operate the converter scheme  at a total power level which is distributed among one or more converters   configured in a deblocked state the controller  programmed to carry out a first stage of decreasing an operating power of at least one converters   in a deblocked state from a first power level to an intermediate power level and then carry out a second stage of increasing the operating power of the or each deblocked converters   from the intermediate power level to a second power level wherein the controller  is further programmed to carry out i a first mode during the first stage so as to reconfigure at least one further converters   from a blocked state to a deblocked state and then increase an operating power of the or each further converter   to the intermediate power level so that the total power level is redistributed among the deblocked converters   at the intermediate power level or ii a second mode during the second stage so as to decrease the operating power of at least one selected of the deblockedconverters   from the intermediate power level and then reconfigure the or each selected converter   from a deblocked state to a blocked state so that the total power level is redistributed
