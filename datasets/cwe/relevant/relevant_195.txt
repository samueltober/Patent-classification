 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To suppress the intrusion of foreign matter into a hub bearingSOLUTION A dust cover  blocks a clearance S between an internal peripheral face  of a round hole  of a knuckle  and an external peripheral face  of an intermediate shaft part  of a drive shaft  which is apart from the internal peripheral face  to the outputside of a vehicle width direction at the inside of a hub bearing  in the vehicle width direction in a state that the drive shaft  and a hub  are connected to each other The dust cover  includes an internal peripheral wall part  an external peripheral wall part  which opposes the internal peripheral wall part  and blocks the clearance S and a connection wall part  Opening parts  for discharging foreign matter such as water mud and sand intruding into the external peripheral wall part  of the dust cover  in a radial direction from a clearance S to the outside of the dust cover  in the radial direction are formed at a plurality of points which are set with intervals in a peripheral direction of the external peripheral wall part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
