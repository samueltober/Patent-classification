 CNB The invention provides a vehicle suspension system comprising negative stiffness devices The vehicle suspension system comprises the negative stiffness devices and an air suspension the negative stiffness devices are symmetrically arranged on the left side and the right side of a body and comprise cylinders pistons push rods limit mechanisms and elastic elements the bottoms of the cylindersare hinged to a chassis frame one end of each piston is mounted in the corresponding cylinder the other end of each piston is connected with one end of the corresponding push rod the other end of each push rod is hinged to the body and the elastic elements are arranged in the cylinders The body with small vibration amplitude is parallelly connected with the suspension and used system stiffness is decreased and the inherent frequency of the body is reduced so that running smoothness of a vehicle is improved When the vibration amplitude of the body is large the negative stiffness devices do not work and running smoothness of the vehicle cannot be affected Working or nonworking of the negative stiffness devices are flexible and adjustable the negative stiffness devices and the active suspension are jointly used the vehicle suspension system adapts to various road conditions the inherent frequency of the body can be reduced when the vibration amplitude of the body is smalland running stability of the vehicle is improved
