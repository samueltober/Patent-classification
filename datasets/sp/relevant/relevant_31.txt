 CNB The invention discloses an intelligent preview control method for emergency rescue vehicle suspension A detection system comprises a vehicle speed detector an electrical control unit ECU a vehiclefront preview sensor and an acceleration sensor The intelligent preview control method for the emergency rescue vehicle suspension comprises the following steps of enabling the vehicle speed detectorto measure current vehicle running speed using the vehicle front preview sensor to measure road surface information within a certain distance in the front using the acceleration sensor to measure acceleration information of front wheels transmitting the measured current information to a preprocessing module in the electrical control unit ECU and calculating a speed node vmax allowed by vehicle front preview control of an active suspension system and comparing the current vehicle running speed and the speed node and enabling the electrical control unit ECU to select to execute a vehicle front preview module or an interaxial preview module so as to form a final control method According to the intelligent preview control method for the emergency rescue vehicle suspension control effects of emergency rescue vehicles during running at high speeds and low speeds are improved and the stability problem of a preview control system when a vehicle runs on a complicated road surface at a high speed is solved
