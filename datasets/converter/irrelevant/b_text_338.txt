 CNB The invention discloses a multiport DC flexible multistate switch device based on a bifurcated bridge arm structure The device consists of a multiport MMC with the bifurcated bridge arm structure and a conventional fullbridge converter wherein AC terminals of the two are connected by a transformer the multiport MMC of a primary side bifurcated bridge arm structure is composed of two phase twelve bridge arms and the intermediate bridge arm is split to form multiple ports The device is advantaged in that modification and integration are performed based on the topology of a traditional modular multilevel converter the highvoltage DC network simultaneously transmits power to multiple lowvoltage DC networks through utilizing a smaller number of switch devices and capacitors by the primary size bifurcated bridge arm structure so respective functional requirements of the DC grid for the flexible multistate switch device are met multiple DC grids of different voltage levels can be connected and power transfer among the multiple DC grids is achieved
