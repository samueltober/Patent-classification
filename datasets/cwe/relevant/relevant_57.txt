 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To obtain a structure which can further improve an intrusion prevention effect of foreign matters into an internal space in which rolling bodies are arranged while securing a degree of freedom of designSOLUTION A plurality of pieces of bolts  for supporting and fixing wheels  and discs  to a rotationside flange  are screwed into screw holes  of the rotationside flange  from the outside of an axial direction An outer end opening part of the internal space  in the axial direction is blocked by a seal ring a Tips of the bolts  are protruded from an inside face of the rotationside flange  in the axial direction to an inner part in the axial direction Tip edges of eaves lips  out of seal members a are made to approximately oppose tip external peripheral faces of the bolts  Weir parts a out of the seal members a and tip faces of the bolts  are superimposed on each other in the axial direction and outside faces of the weir parts a in the axial direction and the tip faces of the bolts  are made to approximately oppose each otherSELECTED DRAWING Figure
