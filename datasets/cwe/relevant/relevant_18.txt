 EPB A bearing assembly having improved impact Brinell resistance is provided Due to a controlled gap between a rotating component and a nonrotating component or a vehicle suspension structure the nonrotating component or the vehicle suspension structure is permitted to share impact loads caused by a sufficient side impact to the rotating component thus preventing excessive loads from being transmitted to rolling elements and providing greater resistance against Brinell impact damage that would generate a noise andor vibration condition in the bearing assembly The width of the controlled gap and of the area of potential contact between the rotating component and the vehicle suspension structure or the nonrotating component are optimized to increase impact Brinell resistance while avoiding excessive contact between the rotating component and the nonrotating component or the vehicle suspension structure during extreme cornering maneuvers
