 USB A control unit rod interface arrangement couples between AC and DC power systems The interface includes at least two poles for coupling between the DC and AC power systems Each of the poles includes a converter for conversion between AC and DC power If a fault has occurred in one of the poles a transient current or fault current may flow through a neutral bus line connected to the pole the poles converter and the location of the fault in the pole Such a transient or fault current should preferably be damped out as quickly as possible after which the pole may be electrically isolated from the other components of the interface arrangement Such a transient or fault current may be damped out relatively quickly by opening of a neutral bus switching element of the neutral bus line connected to the pole after the converter has entered a blocking mode and a circuit breaker at the AC side of the converter has been opened so as to effect discontinuation of flow of current between the AC side of the converter and the AC power system
