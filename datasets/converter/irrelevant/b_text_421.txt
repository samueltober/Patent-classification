 JPA To provide a charging system capable of adjusting charging voltage according to a type of a battery to be chargedSOLUTION In a multicharger unit  a conversion module  operates in an active mode or in a bypass mode In the active mode the conversion module receives an input voltage Vin and converts the input voltage to a fixed output voltage Vfixn In the bypass mode voltage across the output terminals of the conversion module is at substantially zero volt An adjustable converter  converts the input voltage to adjustable output voltage Vadj The output terminals of the conversion module and the output terminals of the adjustable conversion module are connected in series to form a series string A controller  selectively activates the conversion module to be in the active mode or the bypass mode and controls the adjustable conversion module responsive to at least one of load voltage and load current required by a load storage device ST connected across the series stringSELECTED DRAWING Figure A
