 CNA     The invention discloses a forcebearing structure for installing a suspension and a tunnelshaped inner and outer frame on the top of a vehicle including a tunnelshaped inner frame support formed by welding a troughshaped frame assembly a wheel suspension device an inner frame main support column and a top bearing frame Structure the upper end of the tunnelshaped inner frame support structure is installed with a suspension to support the car body and the lower end is installed with all parts of the chassis the tunnelshaped outer frame is welded by the top bearing frame of the outer frame the outer frame column the bottom bearing frame of the outer frame and the outer frame waistline Support structure the bottom surface of the top of the tunnelshaped outer frame support structure is connected with the suspension to form a tunnelshaped outer frame warehouse body frame for suspended passengers or goods The upper lower left and right sides between the inner frame and the outer frame are respectively provided with elastic elements For the elastic wrapping inside the vehicle placing a suspension system on the top of the vehicle is conducive to the sinking of the center of gravity of the vehicle body and making the lateral center of gravity more stable At the same time the doublelayer compressive support of the tunnelshaped inner and outer frames protects both personnel and goods and reduces traffic accidents Risk of injury to personnel and goods
