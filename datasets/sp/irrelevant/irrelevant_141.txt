 CNB The invention discloses a nonindependent suspension frame comprising two obliquelyarranged plate spring assemblies which are symmetrically arranged on the two sides of a vehicle frame Each obliquelyarranged plate spring assembly comprises four obliquelyarranged plate springs wherein the two obliquelyarranged plate springs are located on the tops of the other two obliquelyarranged plate springs one ends of the obliquelyarranged plate springs are connected with the vehicle frame the other ends of the obliquelyarranged plate springs are connected with wheel hub connecting members every two corresponding obliquelyarranged plate springs located on the tops and the vehicle frame form a triangular structure in an enclosed mode and the other two corresponding obliquelyarranged plate springs located at the bottoms and the vehicle frame form a triangular structure in an enclosed mode The nonindependent suspension frame further comprises spring shock absorbers and the two ends of the spring shock absorbers are connected with the vehicle frame and the wheel hub connecting members correspondingly and located on the upper portions of the obliquelyarranged plate spring assemblies According to the nonindependent suspension frame application of the obliquelyarranged plate springs and the spring shock absorbers is combined the carrying capacity and the lateraltilting resistance capacity of a vehicle can be improved wheel positioning parameters are improved the steering angle is increased the bearing center distance is increased tire internallytilting is avoided and abnormal friction of tires is reduced
