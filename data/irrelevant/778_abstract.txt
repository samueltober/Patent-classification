The invention belongs to the field of electrical automation equipment and particularly relates to a transformer integrated multilevel battery energy storage power converter device The device comprises a threewinding transformer six singlephase voltage source inverter bridges a sixphase alternatingcurrent electric reactor six filter capacitors two threephase energy taking transformers two threephase rectifier bridges and two directcurrent filter electric reactors The phase voltage output by the inverter bridges in the device is three levels but a clamping diode of an NPC threelevel inverter is omitted so that the overall cost is lower and the conversion efficiency is higher The sixphase alternatingcurrent electric reactor can better realize the balance of alternatingcurrent side currents of the two threepoint voltage source inverter bridges and can also be realized by adopting two threephase alternatingcurrent electric reactors The primary side and the secondary side of the threewinding transformer can adopt triangular connection or starshaped connection and the secondary side of the threewinding transformer can also increase the number of windings so as to be connected with more inverters and filter circuits so that the capacity of the device is expanded
