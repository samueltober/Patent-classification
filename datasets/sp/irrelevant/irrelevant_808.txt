 CNU The utility model discloses a novel automobile torsion rubber core which comprises a spherical convex part torsion rubber core shafts are fixedly connected to the top and the bottom of the sphericalconvex part mounting holes are formed in the front faces of the torsion rubber core shafts a spherical shaft steel bowl is arranged on the surface of the spherical convex part and a buffer layer isarranged on the surface of the spherical shaft steel bowl According to the utility model the spherical convex part is designed compared with rubber extension of a traditional structure rotation of the spherical convex part is changed the middle shaft can swing within a certain angle the stress is transmitted to the ball shaft steel bowl through the convex part reducing torque force simultaneous big inside and small outside prevention of detachment through the design of the buffer layer the rotation of the spherical convex part in any direction increases the buffer when being stressed the bearing capacity is increased the friction loss of the spherical convex part is greatly reduced and the service life of the torsion rubber core is prolonged so that the effects of falling prevention and long service life are achieved and the problems that the existing torsion rubber core is easy to fall off and short in service life are solved
