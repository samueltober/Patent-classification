The invention discloses a power distribution network feeder interconnection control method based on an FMS and belongs to the technical field of power distribution networks Although the FMS is applied to the power distribution network in the prior art active power flow adjustment and reactive power compensation cannot be better realized the line loss of the power grid cannot be effectively reduced and the upstream pressure of each feeder line of the power grid cannot be effectively relieved The power distribution network feeder interconnection control method based on FMS comprises a multistate switch FMS capable of realizing power flow between feeders and a voltage source type converter used for transmitting active power flow and regulating and controlling electric energy quality According to the method the dq coordinate system regulation and control model is established for the power distribution network and active and reactive decoupling is carried out according to the dq coordinate system regulation and control model so that the flexible multistate switch FMS synchronously and independently regulates and controls the active power and the reactive power and the FMS can synchronously realize active power flow regulation and reactive compensation of the power distribution network
