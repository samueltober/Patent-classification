 JPA To provide a selfpropelled transport bogie using omnidirectional moving wheels having a suspension for enhancing a degree of freedom of the selection of a size of a constituent member such as a damper and a parallel link without imposing an excess load to a drive component such as a motorSOLUTION The transport bogie having omnidirectional moving wheels  motors  and parallel links  comprises wheelside blocks  for supporting the omnidirectional moving wheels  motorside blocks  for supporting the motors  rotation connecting parts  arranged on sideface upper parts of the motorside blocks  transmission rods  connected to sideface lower parts of the wheelside blocks  at lower ends connected to the rotation connecting parts  at upper ends so as to be rotatable respectively and arranged in diagonal directions of the parallel links  dampers  connected to sideface lower parts of the motorside blocks  at lower ends and connected to the rotation connecting parts  at upper ends so as to be rotatable respectively and transmission shafts  having universal joints for connecting drive shafts  of the motors  and wheel shafts  of the omnidirectional moving wheels SELECTED DRAWING Figure
