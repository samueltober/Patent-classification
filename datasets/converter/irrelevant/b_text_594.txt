 CNA The invention relates to a singlecylinder power automatic correcting method for a multipoint injection electronic control engine and belongs to the technical field of engines Temperature sensors are installed on exhaust pipes of cylinders of the engine after an electronic control ECU obtains exhaust temperature data of each cylinder whether the exhaust temperature data are credible or not isanalyzed at first then the exhaust temperature data are converted into the power whether the power of the cylinder is equal to or high than or lower than that of other cylinders is judged throughcomparison if the power is lower than the average level the fuel injection time of the cylinder is prolonged if the power is higher than the average level the fuel injection time is shortened andif the power is equal to the average level the fuel injection time is not changed When the power of a certain cylinder is high the fuel amount of the cylinder is automatically decreased When thepower of a certain cylinder is low the fuel amount of the cylinder is automatically increased and accordingly the powers of the cylinders of the engine are the same
