 EPB Provided is a bearing device for a wheel including a bearing  for a wheel including an outer race  having doublerow outer raceway surfaces   formed on an inner periphery thereof a hub wheel  and an inner race  having doublerow inner raceway surfaces   formed on outer peripheries thereof so as to be opposed to the outer raceway surfaces   and doublerow rolling elements   interposed between the outer raceway surfaces   of the outer race  and the inner raceway surfaces   of the hub wheel  and the inner race  the bearing  for a wheel having a constant velocity universal joint  separably coupled thereto with a screw fastening structure N in which a stem section  of an outer joint member  of the constant velocity universal joint  is fitted to an inner diameter portion of the hub wheel  in which a plurality of convex portions  extending in an axial direction are formed on the stem section  of the outer joint member  and a plurality of concave portions  having an interference with respect to only circumferential side wall portions of each of the plurality of convex portions  are formed on the hub wheel  and the stem section  of the outer joint member  is pressfitted to the hub wheel  and a shape of only the circumferential side wall portions of the each of the convex portions  is transferred to the hub wheel  to thereby provide a convex and concave fitting structure in which the convex portions  and the concave portions are brought into close contact with each other at an entire fitting contact portion therebetween
