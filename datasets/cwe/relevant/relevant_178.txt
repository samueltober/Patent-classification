 KRB     An object of the present invention is to provide an inner ring restraining device for a hub bearing that can efficiently restrain the inner ring without applying a load to the hub bearing The inner ring restraining device  includes a restraining ring  that restrains the inner ring  of the hub bearing  by arranging a plurality of segments a in an annular shape and reducing the diameter thereof and is coaxial with the hub bearing   An annular axially movably installed support plate  and a support plate  for supporting the restraining ring  at a position on the side of the hub bearing  in the axial direction rather than the restraining ring    and axially relatively movable and includes an annular actuating plate  that applies pressure in the axial direction to the restraining ring  by approaching the support plate
