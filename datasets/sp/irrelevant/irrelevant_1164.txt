 USB A vehicle suspension assembly including a suspension control arm pivotally coupled to a vehicle frame member by a bushing assembly The bushing assembly includes a bushing bracket a bushing and a cam adjustment mechanism that couples the bushing bracket to a connection interface of the vehicle frame member The cam adjustment mechanism includes a cam plate rotatably retained on a first fastener such that the cam plate is rotatable relative to the bushing bracket independent of rotation of the first fastener The cam plate is rotatable relative to the first fastener and the bushing bracket about an axis of rotation that is spaced from a centerline of the bushing at a nonparallel orientation Rotation of the cam plate relative to the first fastener adjusts the position of the bushing bracket and therefore the bushing relative to the vehicle frame member to provide alignment adjustment
