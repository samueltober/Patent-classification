 CNU The torsion beam assembly comprises a cross beam component a longitudinal beam component and a hub installation portion the cross beam component extends in the width direction of an automobile body the longitudinal beam component is in an L shape one end of the longitudinal beam component is fixedly connected with the corresponding end of the cross beam component the other end of the longitudinal beam component extends in the length direction of the automobile body and the hub installation portion is connected with the hub installation portion The cross beam component and the two longitudinal beam components are integrally in a U shape the hub installation portions are arranged on the corresponding longitudinal beam components it is guaranteed that the torsion beam assembly can meet good strength requirements and rigidity requirements meanwhile the weight of the torsion beam assembly can be effectively reduced and then the weight of an automobile can be reduced
