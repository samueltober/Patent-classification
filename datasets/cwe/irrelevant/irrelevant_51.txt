 CNU The utility model discloses a hub unit bearing with a pretightening force adjustable structure The bearing comprises an inner ring an outer ring and movable plates the left side of the inner ringpenetrates through the outer ring and extends into the outer ring the left side of the inner ring is fixedly connected with a fixed cover through a fixing bolt and the top and the bottom of the movable plate penetrate through the top and the bottom of the fixed cover respectively and extend out of the fixed cover The utility model discloses a hub unit bearing with a pretightening force adjustable structure The overall pretightening force can be adjusted through the second bolt if the pretightening force is unbalanced the pretightening force is balanced local adjustment can be conducted through the first bolts so that the hub unit bearing is made to be in proper pretightening force work is more stable safety is improved when the pretightening force is too large the balls can contract into the movable grooves friction force between the balls and the outer flange is reduced the outer flange is prevented from being abraded in the rotating process and the service life ofthe bearing is prolonged
