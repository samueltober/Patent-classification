 CNA The invention provides a multidefenseline control method for a DC power grid system fault and a DC power grid system The DC power grid system comprises at least two groups of DC buses a sourceendconverter and a DC transmission line each group of DC buses comprises a positive bus and a negative bus the sourceend converter provides a converter of a DC power supply for the DC buses and theinput side of the converter is connected with an alternatingcurrent power supply or a DC power supply or another DC bus the DC transmission line is connected with any two groups of DC buses and when a shortcircuit fault occurs in the DC power grid system the control method comprises at least two of the following three kinds of control first currentlimiting mode defense line control limiting a fault current at the initial stage of the fault through a current limiting device second current control mode defense line control controlling the fault current within a safe range through the source end converter or the current control device third cutoff mode defense line control isolating faults through a breaking device on a DC transmission line where the fault point is located
