 CNU A structure for accommodating a wheel speed sensor and a drive shaft for a vehicle the structure for accommodating the wheel speed sensor comprising a drive shaft a hub bearing a knuckle and a protective cover the driving shaft is connected with an inner ring of the hub bearing the steering knuckle is connected with an outer ring of the hub bearing the protective cover is annular and sleeves the outer side of the driving shaft and the distance between the protective cover and the knuckle is smaller than a first preset distance and the driving shaft the hub bearing the steering knuckle and the protective cover jointly form a space for accommodating the wheel speed sensor The protection cover is arranged between the driving shaft and the steering knuckle so that magnetic substances such as scrap iron are prevented from entering the sensing range of the wheel speed sensor to influence the electromotive force sensed by the wheel speed sensor and the accuracy of the tested vehicle speed is ensured And meanwhile by means of the arrangement foreign matter is prevented from entering the common space of the driving shaft the hub bearing the steering knuckle and the protective cover  mutual movement between the driving shaft and the inner ring of the hub bearing and between the inner ring of the hub bearing and the outer ring of the hub bearing is prevented from being affected and the service life of components is prolonged
