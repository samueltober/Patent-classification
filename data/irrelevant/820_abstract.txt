The invention discloses a multibit analogtodigital converter capable of effectively reducing power consumption relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit and aims to solve the problems of high power consumption and long time delay caused by the fact that a converter in the prior art depends on resistance A thermometer code generation module adjusts the threshold voltage of the corresponding phase inverter by using MOS transistors with different sizes converts an input analog signal into a thermometer code and inputs the thermometer code into the inverse code generation module the inverse code generation module is used for respectively outputting the same thermometer code and the inverse code thereof to the code conversion circuit according to the input thermometer code and the code conversion circuit converts the input thermometer code and the inverse code thereof into a plurality of binary codes and outputs the binary codes to the outside The converter has the advantages that the conversion from the analog signal to the thermometer code is completed without depending on a resistor and all functional circuits have no static power consumption so lower power consumption and lower signal delay can be realized
