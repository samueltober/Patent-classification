The present invention provides a multifunctional manmachine interactive ground proximity warning control board device and an interaction method The FPGA core processor is used to realize the key scanning indicator light control task data loading and communication with the ground proximity warning computer of the ground proximity warning control board Communication through the flashing different colors of the warning prompt color block light and the warning button indicator light to give pilots different danger levels to ensure that the pilot can see the warning prompt in time to avoid danger suppress the warning through the warning button to meet the suppression of the warning The function mode button can be used to switch between different modes to improve the pilots understanding of the flight status of the aircraft the USB task data interface can be used to upload mission data or download flight record data adjust the brightness knob to meet The display requirements for the brightness of characters on the control panel in different environments ensure that the pilot can accurately and clearly see the display of the corresponding warning and function mode characters
