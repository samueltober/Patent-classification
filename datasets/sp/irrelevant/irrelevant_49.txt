 CNB The invention belongs to the technical field of shock absorption and energy conservation of vehicles and particularly relates to a plate spring shock absorber generating mechanism based on ball matching The plate spring shock absorber generating mechanism comprises a main vehicle beam an auxiliary vehicle beam a plate spring slide sleeves a screwrodsupporting power generator a first supporting slide bar a second supporting slide bar a guide rail screw rods a screw rod fixing block a ball rotating pair a bearing a guide rail fixing sleeve a locking nut plate spring slide grooves a pulley a pulley fixing structure and a slide bar groove One ends of the slide bars slide on the guide rail through the slide sleeves and the other ends of the slide bars slide in the plate spring slide grooves through the pulley When the plate spring vibrates the slide bars slide to amplify the vibration motion of the plate spring and convert the vibration motion into reciprocating motion of the slide sleeves on the guide rail the reciprocating motion is converted into rotating motion of the ball rotating pair through matching between balls and the screw rods and therefore the power generator is driven to generate power According to the invention the slide bars slide to amplify the vibration motion of the plate spring the reciprocating motion is converted into the rotating motion through matching between the balls and the screw rods and therefore the energy can be saved
