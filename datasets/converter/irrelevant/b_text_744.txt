 CNU The utility model discloses a multifunctional bus board card based on an FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array which takes an ARM Advanced RISC Machines controller as a core encodes and decodes the ARM controller through an FPGA chip sends a signal to a driving chip for signal output simultaneously receives a bus signal converts the bus signal into TTL TransistorTransistor Logic level analyzes the FPGA data and transmits the data to the ARM controller through an FMC bus The data is transmitted to an upper computer through a control interface RS for bus signal data display and meanwhile the upper computer sends data to the ARM controller the data is transmitted to the FPGA through the FMC bus and then a bus signal is output through the driver According to the technical scheme provided by the utility model the ARM  FPGA  driving chip is used for realizing the functions of various buses on the same board card and the various buses are designed to be an ARINC bus core an ARINC bus core and an ARINC bus core of the FPGA of one board card so that the board card is very flexible and convenient
