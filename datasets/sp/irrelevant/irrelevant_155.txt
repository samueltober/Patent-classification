 CNB The invention discloses an electronically controlled suspension and an ABS linkage control system A groove is formed in the right end of a piston base of an active suspension system a convex block matched with the groove is arranged at the left end of a controlled piston a spring is arranged on the outer circumference of the convex block and a control cylinder is arranged on the right side ofa controlled piston rod a sealing block is arranged between the control cylinder and an electromagnet the control cylinder is sealed and communicated with a first interface of an electromagnetic valve through an oil pipe and second and third interfaces of the electromagnetic valve are sealed and communicated with a brake subpump and a brake fluid reservoir respectively turning onoff of the electromagnetic valve is controlled by three parallel relays and the three relay control turning onoff of a circuit through a normally open valve a normally closed valve and a hydraulic pump respectively when the electromagnetic valve is in a poweroff state the first and third interfaces are communicated and when the electromagnetic valve is in an energized state the first and second interfaces are communicated In an acting process of the ABS system a pressing displacement value of a car head and a lifting displacement value of a car tail are prevented from fluctuating with the fluctuation changes of a braking force and passengers in a car can feel more comfortable
