 USA In a power converter a switching network having switches that operate at a common frequency and duty cycle interconnects circuit elements These circuit elements include capacitors that are in a capacitor network and a magnetic filter When connected to the capacitors by a switch from the switching network the magnetic filter imposes a constraint upon intercapacitor charge transfer between the capacitors to maintain the filters second terminal at a voltage The switching network transitions between states These states include a first state a second state and a third state In both the first state and the third state the first magneticfilter terminal couples to the capacitor network In the second state which occurs between the first and third state the switches ground the first magneticfilter terminal
