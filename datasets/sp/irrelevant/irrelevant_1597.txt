 CNA The invention discloses an adaptive control method of a vehicle active suspension system considering time lag interference which comprises the following steps establishing a nonlinear active suspension system model with input time lag and obtaining a kinetic equation of an active suspension according to a Newton second law designing a selfadaptive backstepping controller capable of resistingtime lag interference analyzing the influence of the time lag on the system calculating the critical time lag of the controlled suspension system and obtaining the controllable time lag range of the selfadaptive backstepping controller selecting proper gains k and k and feedback coefficients l l ls and lc so that all constraints of the nonlinear system can be limited within a reasonable range under the influence of a certain time lag range and control indexes are met according to the method the problems that an existing vehicle nonlinear suspension model is simple a control target is single and the like are solved and the problems of controller time lag interference sprung mass uncertainty and model dynamic stability under the vehicle driving condition are also solved
