 CNB The invention relates to the technical field of vehicle damping and discloses a hydraulic halfaxle shaft suspension device for a transport vehicle The device comprises an oil cylinder connected to the bottom of a frame the end part of the oil cylinder is rotatably connected with the frame through a movable pin a support lug plate is arranged at the end part of the oil cylinder and a supporting plate can rotate around a main pin after being extruded by the oil cylinder An adjusting arm is connected with a push rod through a shifting fork and a cotter pin when the push rod is pushed outthe push rod can push the adjusting arm to rotate around a camshaft therefore when the vehicle travels on a road surface with a large gradient difference the speed can be reduced and buffering canbe realized when a driver drives a vehicle on a bumpy road surface the driver does not need to step on a brake suddenly to achieve rapid braking With the device the function of synchronous speed reduction in the buffering process can be realized so that the safety performance and comfort performance of driving can be guaranteed
