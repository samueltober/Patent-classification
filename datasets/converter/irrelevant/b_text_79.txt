 EPB A method in a power inverter system  is disclosed wherein the power inverter system comprises a central unit  and a plurality of switching units  operable in an inverter mode in which they are individually switched so as to produce a combined output voltage waveform and AC VOUT transmitted in a common line  and operable in a communication mode in which the switching units are switched so as to produce a communication signal the communication signal being transmitted in the common line to the central unit The method comprises operating at least some of the switching units in the inverter mode such that they are switched in response to switching commands of a command signal produced by the central unitand between two consecutive switching commands of the command signal operating at least one of the switching units in the communication mode
