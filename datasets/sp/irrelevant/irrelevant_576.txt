 CNA The invention discloses a top mount of a shock absorber The top mount comprises a shell a vibration isolation component and an end cover The vibration isolation component is ringshaped and is provided with a first end surface a second end surface and an outer contour surface and the outer contour surface of the vibration isolation component is a concave surface sunken towards a center shaft The first end surface and the second end surface are oblique and the thickness of the position between the first end surface and the second end surface is gradually decreased in the direction getting close to the outer contour surface a certain included angle alpha is formed between the first end surface and the transverse central surface of the vibration isolation component and between the second end surface and the transverse central surface of the vibration isolation component and the alpha is no less than  degrees and no more than  degrees the first end surface is in contact withthe inner side surface of the end cover to form a first contact surface and the second end surface is in contact with the bottom surface of an inner cavity to form a second contact surface and thevibration isolation component is axially clamped between the end cover and the shell by the end cover and the shell through the first contact surface and the second contact surface and a clearance isformed between the cambered surface of the outer contour surface and the side wall of the cylindrical inner cavity When the top mount of the shock absorber works the side surface of the shell can be unstressed and friction is avoided the damping effect is improved and the noise is reduced and the wear of components is avoided
