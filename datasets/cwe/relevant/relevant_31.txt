 EPB Provided is a bearing device for a wheel that can realize prevention of a backlash in a circumferential direction and is excellent in workability of connection of a hub wheel and an outer joint member of a constant velocity universal joint Further provided is a bearing device for a wheel that can prevent deterioration in NVH characteristics which is caused by the backlash occurring in a joint section between the hub wheel and the constant velocity universal joint or between an outer member and a knuckle and can perform rotation torque transmission with high accuracy The bearing device includes a recessprojection fitting structure M in which the hub wheel  and a shaft section  which is fitted in a hole  of the hub wheel  of the outer joint member of the constant velocity universal joint  are unitized together In the recessprojection fitting structure M entire fitting regions among projections  on the outer surface of the shaft section  of the outer joint member and recesses  which fit on the projections are brought into intimate contact with each other
