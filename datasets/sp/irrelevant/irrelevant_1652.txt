 CNA The invention discloses a balanced suspension structure which comprises a balanced suspension support an axle assembly and a plate spring and further comprises a thrust rod and a thrust rod supportthe thrust rod support is fixed to the axle assembly and the two ends of the thrust rod are hinged to the balanced suspension support and the thrust rod support through pin shafts respectively The included angle between the axis of the thrust rod and the horizontal line ranges from  degree to  degrees and in the compression deformation process of the plate spring the end connected with thethrust rod support of the thrust rod is lower than the end connected with the balanced suspension support of the thrust rod all the time According to the balanced suspension structure the workingangle of the lower thrust rod is optimized the vertical component force of the thrust rod is reduced and meanwhile a key bearing part is reinforced so that the suspension is suitable for a driveaxle group of a heavy special chassis
