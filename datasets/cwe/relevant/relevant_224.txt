 WOA Provided is a technique which makes it possible to produce a bearing unit with higher accuracy A hub unit manufacturing device  comprises a shaft pressfitting part  configured such that in a state where an inner ring support base  is disposed facing an inner ring  at one end in the central axial direction of a bearing unit  where a hub main body  is disposed on the side opposite the one end in the central axial direction of the bearing unit  such that a tip end of a shaft part  is made to face an inner ring  and where the tip end of the shaft part  is in contact with an inner circumferential surface of the inner ring  the shaft pressfitting part presses the hub main body  toward the inner rings   so as to press and secure the inner rings   to the inner ring support base  and pressfits the shaft part  to the inner circumferential surfaces of the inner rings   and an outer ring rotation driving part  that causes an outer ring  to rotate about the center axis of the outer ring  while the inner rings   are pressed and secured to the inner ring support base
