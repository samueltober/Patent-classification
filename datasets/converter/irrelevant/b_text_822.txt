 CNA The invention discloses a power conversion method and system for a multimodular electric vehicle charging station The method comprises the steps that  KV highvoltage alternating current introduced from a power grid side passes through a threephase rectifier module and then is conveyed to a multimodular charging station and finally an electric vehicle is charged through a charging gun The system comprises a rectifier module used for converting highvoltage alternating current into direct current and a current conversion module which is used for converting the direct current obtained by conversion of the rectifier module into direct current meeting the charging standard of the electric vehicle Compared with a traditional KV automobile charging station power conversion system a KVV transformer is omitted KV alternating current is directly converted into direct current the voltage stress of a switch tube is reduced and harmonic pollution is reduced transmission is achieved through thin cables materials are saved and cost is reduced and the voltage level of each converter can be reduced to kilovolt level or even lower so that the switching frequency reaches a higher level and the power density is further improved
