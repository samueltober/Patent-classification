The invention discloses an underwater robot propeller modular drive circuit and a driving method thereof A current detection module detects working current of a propeller in real time current detection results are transmitted to a master control CPU central processing unit module in analog voltage signal form the master control CPU module receives the information about the current detection results and generates corresponding control voltage signals according to actual conditions an APWM analog pulse width modulation module receives the control voltage signals from the master controlCPU module converts them into PWM signals and transmits the PWM signals to a PWM power amplification module so as to control speed and output push of the propeller
