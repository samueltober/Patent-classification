The invention discloses a converter transformer multidimensional analysis and early warning method based on multistage decision fusion and relates to the technical field of converter transformer monitoring The method comprises the steps obtaining a state quantity monitoring value of a converter transformer judging whether the obtained state quantity monitoring value exceeds a threshold valueor not according to a set criterion if not outputting an early warning signal if yes executing the step  wherein the set criterion at least comprises the step that a prediction algorithm is adopted to monitor the state quantity establishing a converter transformer cooling system fan operation power cooling capacity quantification model determining the weights of different evaluation indexes by using an entropy method and comprehensively judging and evaluating whether the converter transformer load margin is enough or not and if not outputting an early warning signal and if so continuing to monitor the running state of the converter transformer According to the method the converter transformer operation state is analyzed and evaluated from different dimensions
