The invention provides a multiprocess collaborative hazardous waste disposal and waste heat utilization system and method The problems that an existing solid hazardous waste disposal mode cannot achieve complete harmlessness of waste and is low in energy utilization rate are solved According to the system and the method carbon residues and pyrolysis gas are generated after hazardous wastes enter a pyrolysis furnace the carbon residues are discharged in the form of harmless glass bodies after hightemperature melting the pyrolysis gas is mixed with flue gas of a plasma melting furnace and then subjected to secondary combustion the hightemperature flue gas obtained after combustion enters a waste heat boiler and the pyrolysis furnace for heat exchange and then quenching deacidification dust removal washing reheating and discharging are conducted Deoxygenated water exchanges heat with hightemperature flue gas in the waste heat boiler to generate superheated steam the superheated steam drives a steam turbine to do work then enters a flue gas reheater and an ORC evaporator for heat exchange and then is condensed and then enters a deaerator for deoxygenation treatment An organic working medium evaporates in the ORC evaporator to generate superheated steam then the superheated steam enters an ORC turbine to do work and the superheated steam enters the ORC evaporator again to be evaporated and subjected to heat exchange after being condensed to generate the superheated steam
