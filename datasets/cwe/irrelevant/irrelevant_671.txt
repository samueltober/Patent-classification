 CNU The commercial vehicle hub comprises a side wall and a connecting flange the side wall comprises an inner surface and an outer surface the outer surface is in a bigenddown cone shape the connecting flange extends towards the outer side from the bottom of the outer surface in the radial direction of the hub and a plurality of bolt holes are formed in the connecting flange a plurality of spigots are convexly formed in the outer surface of the side wall each spigot comprises a supporting surface located on the outer side of the spigot and perpendicular to the radial direction of the hub and an inner side face opposite to the supporting surface a first connecting part is formed at the joint of the bottom end of the supporting surface and the outer surface of the side wall and a second connecting part is formed at the joint of the bottom end of the inner side face and the outer surface of the side wall the distance between the first connecting part and the connecting flange is smaller than the distance between the second connecting part and the connecting flange The supporting rigidity of the hub to the spigot is improved and then the driving safety of a vehicle is improved
