 CNA The invention relates to an automobile with a side impact energy absorption structure The automobile comprises an automobile frame a drive axle a steering axle vertically telescopic automobile shock absorbers and two side bumpers distributed on the two sides of the automobile frame in the length direction of the steering axle wherein the two ends of the drive axle respectively support the automobile frame through the automobile shock absorbers the two ends of the steering axle respectively support the automobile frame through one takeout shock absorber the automobile frame is providedwith a drive axle part cross beam located above the drive axle and a steering axle part cross beam located above the steering axle one ends of the side bumpers are connected with the drive axle partcross beam through drive axle side collision energy absorption mechanisms and the other ends of the side bumpers are connected with the steering axle part cross beam through axle housing side collision energy absorption mechanisms According to the automobile with the side impact energy absorption structure side impact energy can be absorbed without crumpling deformation of the automobile framewhen side impact occurs and the shock absorbers supporting the automobile frame also participate in side impact energy absorption so that the problems of poor safety and single function of the shockabsorbers due to the fact that an automobile body needs to crumple to absorb energy during side impact of an existing automobile are solved
