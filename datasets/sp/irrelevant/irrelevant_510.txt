 CNA The invention discloses a steering energy feedback suspension based on a switched reluctance linear rotating motor A motor cavity a rotating shaft cavity and a sliding cavity are formed in a shell in an axial direction from top to bottom the switched reluctance linear rotating motor is arranged in the motor cavity and a mechanical rotating shaft is sequentially provided with a motor section asliding section and a steering section from top to bottom in the axial direction The motor section is coaxially positioned in the motor cavity the sliding section is positioned in the rotating shaft cavity and the sliding cavity and the steering section extends out of the shell A cylindrical thrust disc fixedly sleeves the sliding section the inner wall of the sliding cavity is in clearancefit connection with the outer wall of a connecting plug ring in a radial direction and the cylindrical thrust disc sleeves the sliding section and is installed in the connecting plug ring A spiral spring upper supporting plate and a spiral spring coaxially sleeve the shell and the lower end of the steering section is connected with a hub through a steering knuckle and a half shaft According tothe present invention the suspension system is endowed with a steering function an original steering system is omitted the chassis structure of an automobile is simplified and the structural interference during largeamplitude steering is eliminated
