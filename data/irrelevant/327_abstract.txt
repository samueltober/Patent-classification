The invention discloses a modular multilevel converter startup circuit and a startup and lowspeed operation method thereof The startup circuit includes five parts a DC power supply Udc a series switch a diode D an auxiliary power supply E and an improved modular multilevel converter The series circuit of the auxiliary power supply E the series diode D the DC power supply Udc and the series switch is connected in parallel to the DC end of the improved modular multilevel converter Because the auxiliary power supply is added to reduce the voltage value of the DC side the capacitor voltage fluctuation of the sub module is greatly reduced and stable operation under an extremely low speed can be realized Compared with the traditional method of injecting highfrequency components to reduce the fluctuation of capacitor voltage the insulation safety and service life of a motor can be ensured without applying a largeamplitude common mode voltage to the motor on one hand and onthe other hand the current amplitude of the bridge arm can be ensured to be within the rated current without injecting any highfrequency loop current and the high efficiency of the converter is ensured
