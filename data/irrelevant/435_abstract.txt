The invention discloses an ACDC hybrid microgrid optimization operation method considering random fuzzy double uncertainty which comprises the steps of defining the illumination intensity as a random variable defining the wind speed as a random fuzzy variable and carrying out uncertainty modeling on output of intermittent energy on the basis of characteristics of a ACDC hybrid microgrid and considering uncertainty of windsolar output based on a grid structure of the microgrid introducing a random fuzzy theory into the ACDC hybrid microgrid establishing a random fuzzy opportunity constraint optimization model with optimal dayahead scheduling economy and further adjusting unbalanced power to realize an optimal output combination of a unit and solving the random fuzzy opportunityconstraint optimization model with the optimal dayahead scheduling economy by using a hybrid intelligent algorithm combining random fuzzy simulation a neural network and a chaotic particle swarm algorithm to obtain a final ACDC hybrid microgrid optimization operation scheme According to the method the problem of large deviation of the dayahead scheduling scheme of the microgrid caused by windsolar output uncertainty is effectively solved and the adjustment of unbalanced power is reduced
