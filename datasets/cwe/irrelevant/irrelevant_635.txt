 CNA The invention discloses an intermediate structure of a transmission shaft and relates to the field of automobile transmission shafts The intermediate structure comprises an intermediate connecting fork an intermediate spline shaft a support and circular rings wherein the intermediate connecting fork is connected with the intermediate spline shaft through a spline in a matched manner the circular rings are sleeved on journals of the intermediate connecting fork and the intermediate spline shaft correspondingly a support bearing is mounted between the two circular rings the support is installed on the support bearing rubber sealing lips are arranged at the positions close to the rings of the upper end and the lower end of the support and the rubber sealing lips make contact with the corresponding rings for sealing The method has the beneficial effect that the spline heat treatment deformation is prevented from being transmitted to the sealing contact part Besides the circular ring is made of nonsteel materials such as nylon so that the sound of contact friction between rubber and the circular ring is smaller the sealing interference design can be increased and the muddy water resistance is enhanced
