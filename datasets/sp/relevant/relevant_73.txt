 FRA         A onepiece lower cup  for suspension stop  intended to be interposed between an upper end of a helical spring and an upper support  has a lower face  forming an axial support shoulder  for the upper end of the helical spring which includes an indexing stop  extending in an axial plane for angular indexing of the upper end of the helical spring with respect to the lower onepiece cup  of an axis of revolution  of the suspension stop The lower onepiece cup  has a differentiated stiffening reinforcement    giving the lower onepiece cup  a stiffness in axial compression whose value is greater than a given threshold at any point of the shoulder axial support  located in a first angular zone A around the axis of revolution  including the indexing stop  and is lower than said threshold given at any point on the axial support shoulder  situated in a second angular zone around the axis of revolution
