 CNA The invention discloses a vehicle mechanical active suspension mechanism The problems that a current active suspension is high in price and too high in later maintenance cost are mainly solved and the performance of certain aspects of the active suspension is further improved The mechanism is characterized in that the upper end of a damping spring and the upper end of a shock absorber in a suspension are connected with a worm wheel swing arm and then the worm wheel swing arm is connected with a vehicle body through a worm wheel and worm mechanism and an ECU controls a servo motor to drivea worm to rotate the worm wheel swing arm and the suspension connected with the worm wheel swing arm are driven to ascend and descend relative to the vehicle body so that the height of the vehiclesuspension is adjusted According to the mechanism a lever member is used to adjust a pivot point of an upper arm of a transverselyarranged doublefork arm suspension relative to the vehicle body the problem that the inclination angle of a wheel in the ascending and descending process of the suspension is too large is solved a novel fourrod forkshaped longitudinallyarranged swing arm is adopted to improve the supporting performance of the suspension a braking mechanism is arranged in the middle of an antitilting rod the broken antitilting rods are combined by a dog clutch so that the defect of the antitilting rod in the traditional suspension is avoided and the performance is further improved
