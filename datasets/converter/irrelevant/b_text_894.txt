 CNU     The utility model provides a charging and discharging and controlling power supply device for a highvoltage SVG power module which includes a high isolation withstand voltage singlephase charging transformer T a rectifier Z a current limiting resistor R and a twophase normally closed contact relay J connected in sequence  Low isolation withstand voltage singlephase power transformer T and chain link control board and also includes a singlephase normally open contact relay J connected in parallel with the current limiting resistor R the twophase normally closed contact relay J and SVG power module Connect the DC capacitor C on The utility model can greatly reduce the high cost of high isolation and withstand voltage singlephase charging transformer and low partial discharge index and the disadvantages of the power modules own slow discharge speed etc and the power supply is reliable the utility model can also be applied to other high voltage charging and control Electric power electronic converter devices such as multilevel modular converters
