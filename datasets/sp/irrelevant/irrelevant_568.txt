 CNB The invention relates to an automobile suspension system based on visual sensor technology and a pavement nonflatness measurement method Based on the automobile suspension system a system camera isadopted to prescan a road surface condition in front of a vehicle and firstly a segmentation method based on an image gray threshold is applied to identify and plan the edge of a rough road surface and secondly a geometric structure characteristic method based on monocular vision is designed to calculate the rough area so that a function model of the rough road surface area is constructed so as to obtain road surface nonflatness parameters The hysteresis quality problem of semiactive suspension regulation can be effectively solved and the problem of hysteresis quality of a suspension system in the prior art can be solved
