 AUA A hubcap for a heavyduty duty vehicle that includes mounting structure that is formed with and cooperates with a side wall of the hubcap to provide a stiff rigid structure that enables noncantilevered connection to a wheel hub The mounting structure can be a plurality of elongated bosses circumferentially spaced about the side wall that are formed with corresponding elongated bolt openings to enable the noncantilevered attachment to the wheel hub The elongated bosses cooperate with the hubcap side wall to provide a stiffened or rigid structure between the elongated bolt openings for increased and more uniform clamping force on a sealing gasket between the hubcap and the wheel hub The hubcap profile provides clearance for removal of an outboard mounted disc brake rotor in heavyduty vehicle wheel end assemblies that include such rotor configurations The hubcap may support simple mounting of a hubodometer
