A resonant power supply  is provided for ozone generation The power supply  advantageously reduces costs and increases reliability of ozone generators The power supply  provides a first AC voltage from a power source  to a resonant circuit  and the resonant circuit  provides a second AC voltage to the ozone generating unit  the second AC voltage being greater than the first AC voltage A controller  for the power supply  that adapts to the resonance of the circuit to provide control with a wide tolerance for the high Q circuit component values of the circuit
