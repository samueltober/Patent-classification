 CNA The invention discloses a rear suspension structure integrating multiconnecting rods and transverse plate springs Trailing arms are arranged in a direction nearly parallel to the horizontal forwarddirection of a vehicle fixed to the inner sides of steering knuckles and hinged to a vehicle body framework a transverse plate spring assembly is arranged between every two symmetric wheels at thetwo sides of the vehicle and the middle of each transverse plate spring assembly is fixed to the vehicle body framework through a fixing support a plate spring tail mounting support is mounted at the end of each transverse plate spring assembly and hinged to a connecting block each connecting block is hinged to the middle of a lower swinging arm and each lower swinging arm is fixed to the inner side of the corresponding steering knuckle and hinged to the vehicle body framework By means of the rear suspension structure the bearing capacity of the finished vehicle can be improved the transverse loading space of the finished vehicle can be increased the height of an underpan is effectively lowered and the rear suspension structure has the advantages that the height of the underpan is low the transverse loading space is large the lateral supporting performance is good the bearing capacity is strong and maintenance is easy light weight of the finished vehicle is achieved andthe bearing ratio is increased
