 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To realize a structure capable of preventing an assembling characteristic of a cap from being reduced and capable of assuring sufficiently a hermetic seal characteristicSOLUTION A fitted core grid a constituting a cap a is configured by an inner diameter side cylindrical part  an outward flange part  formed under a state where it is extended out of an inner end part in an axial direction of the inner diameter side cylindrical part  to outside in a radial direction and an outer diameter side cylindrical part  formed under a state where it is extended out of the outer end part in a radial direction of the outward flange part  A portion of the cap main body a a part positioned outside in a radial direction rather than the inner diameter side cylindrical part  and a part aligning with the outer diameter side cylindrical part  in respect to its axial direction is divided into an outer peripheral surface of the inner diameter side cylindrical part  an inner diameter side resin part  present between it and the inner peripheral surface of the outer diameter side cylindrical part  and an outer diameter side resin part  present at an outer diameter side of the outer peripheral surface of this outer diameter side cylindrical part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
