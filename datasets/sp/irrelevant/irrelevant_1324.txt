 CNA The embodiment of the invention provides a driving device and relates to the technical field of robots The device comprises a first support a second support which is connected with the first support in a rotating manner a first driving assembly which is connected with the first support and used for driving a chassis to move a spring shock absorber with two ends connected with the first support and the second support respectively so as to reduce vibration generated when the second support rotates around the first support a limiting mechanism which is arranged between the first support andthe second support and can move due to rotation between the first support and the second support a locking mechanism which can limit the displacement of the limiting mechanism so that the first support and the second support cannot generate relative displacement According to the device the spring shock absorber can be locked through the locking limiting mechanism to be limited to float up anddown the operation precision requirement of the robot is met and the problems that an existing method is high in cost and large in occupied space are solved
