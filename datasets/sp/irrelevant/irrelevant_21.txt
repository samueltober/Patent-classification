 CNB The present invention aims to provide a suspension device for a rear wheel which suppresses or cancels influence of a vertical force compliance steering at the beginning of turning The suspension device comprises a housing which supports the rear wheel of a vehicle rotatably around an axis suspension links in which both endpoints are respectively swingably attached to a vehicle body and a hubbearing so that the housing is strokably supported with respect to the vehicle body a suspension spring which generates a reaction force according to relative displacement amount of the housing withrespect to the vehicle body in the vertical direction and a damper which generates a damping force according to a relative speed of the hub bearing housing with respect to the vehicle body in the vertical direction The suspension device has the vertical force compliance steering characteristics in which the rear wheel is steered in the toein side or toeout side according to increase of a vertical force applied to a rear wheel tread The suspension device includes toe change generation means temporarily generating a toe change of which direction cancels or suppresses a toe change caused bythe vertical force compliance characteristics at the beginning of turning of the vehicle
