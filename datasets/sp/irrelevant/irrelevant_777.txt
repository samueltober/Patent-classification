 CNA The invention provides a control method of an active suspension system with state constraint and dead zone input and relates to the technical field of automobile suspension control According to themethod the problems that when an existing vehicle is on an uneven road surface the requirement for keeping comfort cannot be met the nonlinear problem caused by dead zone input is not considered inthe controller design process and consequently the actual performance of a vehicle suspension system is reduced are solved The method comprises the following steps an actuator model with nonlinearinput in an active suspension system is established a  vehicle active suspension system model with state constraint and dead zone input is established the  vehicle active suspension system model with state constraint and dead zone input is utilized a corresponding controller is designed a Lyapunov function is adopted to verify the active suspension system model with state constraint anddead zone input in the  vehicle and the control method of the active suspension system with the state constraint and dead zone input is completed
