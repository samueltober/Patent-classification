 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of electric vehicle hub motors The utility model relates to a clutch in particular to an inwardswinging flail block centrifugal clutch Wherein themotor and the hub are arranged on the center shaft in a sleeving mode an overrunning clutch is arranged on the left side of the motor the outer portion of the overrunning clutch is connected with aplanet assembly through a center gear the inner side of the planet assembly is connected with the motor through a motor left inner cover and the outer side of the planet assembly is connected with abrake part through a left end cover The right side of the motor is connected with an inner swing type flail block mechanism through a motor right inner cover the outer side of the inner swing typeflail block mechanism is connected with a right end cover and the right end cover and the left end cover are both connected with the hub The inner swing type flail block centrifugal clutch is adopted to drive power output and therefore hub rotation is achieved Compared with a traditional structure the inward swing type flail block centrifugal clutch is simple in structure free in gear shifting and speed changing more stable in transmission high in transmission efficiency low in production cost and easy to popularize and use
