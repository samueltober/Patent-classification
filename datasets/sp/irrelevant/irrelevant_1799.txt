 CNA The invention relates to a piston cylinder oil cavity damper The piston cylinder oil cavity damper comprises a hollow oil cavity an upper piston head valve a lower piston head valve a lower oil cavity and a compensation cavity The piston cylinder oil cavity damper is provided with an upper oil cavity the lower oil cavity and the compensation cavity each oil cavity carries out oil displacement through a piston valve port a piston head connected with the lower end of a piston cylinder is used for carrying out oil displacement a secondary rod the piston cylinder integrally moves in the lower oil cavity the lower oil cavity adopts a hollow cylinder the lower end piston valve is arranged below the cylinder in a matched manner and the lower end piston valve is located in a circular sinking groove  machined in the bottom of the compensation cavity The invention aims to provide an improved damper which can be matched with an electromagnetic active suspension The structure of the damper is reasonably utilized to optimize the space of an electromagnetic active suspension and the like In addition high supporting rigidity is provided high bending moment resistance is achieved and meanwhile the installation space is reduced In addition the internal space of the damper piston cylinder serves as the upper oil cavity so that the structure is optimized
