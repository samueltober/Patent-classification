 EPB A method of manufacturing a rolling bearing unit for supporting a wheel includes detecting a current value flowing through an electric motor  configured to drive a roll  and determining a time to terminate a caulking process on the basis of the detected value when a caulking section  is formed by pressing the roll  inclined with respect to a central axis of a hub main body  and supported in a rotatable state about a central axis of the roll against a cylindrical section  installed on an inner end portion of the hub main body  in the axial direction while the roll  is rotated about the central axis of the hub main body
