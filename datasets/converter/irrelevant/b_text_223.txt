 EPB Disclosed are switchedmode DCDC power converter modules SMPC controllers and distributedcontrol multiphase SMPC systems The controller comprises a reference clock a synchronisation input configured to receive a first synchronisation signal a synchronisation output configured to transmit a second synchronisation signal a control unit configured to control the operation of the SMPC module with a phase determined by the reference clock signal or the first synchronisation signal a delay line configured to generate the second synchronisation signal by adding a delay to the selected one of the first synchronisation signal and the reference clock signal a fault detection terminal a memory configured to store a datum corresponding to a number N of SMPCs in the system and a delay calculation module configured to calculate the delay in dependence on the datum and the signal at the faultdetection terminal Associated methods are also disclosed
