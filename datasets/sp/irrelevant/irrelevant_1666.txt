 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of automobile control methods in particular to a control method for improving the driving comfort of a crosscountry automobile The method comprises steps of acquiring a vertical acceleration signal of the vehicle body acquiring a vertical acceleration rootmeansquare value and a rootmeansquare value change rate of the vehicle body based on the vertical acceleration signal acquiring a vibration frequency and a vibration frequency change rate corresponding to the maximum power spectrum and performing twodimensional damping fuzzy control on the basis of the vertical acceleration rootmeansquare value and the rootmeansquare value change rate to obtain optimal damping performing twodimensional rigidity fuzzy control on the basis of the vibration frequency corresponding to the maximum power spectrum and the vibration frequency change rate to obtain the optimal rigidity correcting the optimal damping and the optimal rigidity to obtain target damping and target rigidity and enabling a suspension controller of the vehicle body to adjust the damping of the suspension to the target damping and adjust the rigidity to the target rigidity The target damping and the target rigidity are obtained the purpose of improving the driving comfort is achieved through active adjustment and the vehicle body vibration frequency can be far away from the human body resonance frequency range
