 KRB Disclosed is a stabilizer bar bush which can strongly grip a stabilizer bar to prevent a slip in a circumferential direction or a lateral direction of the stabilizer bar while reducing bearing stiffness in a horizontal direction or a vertical direction and improving elasticity compared to the prior art thereby smoothly buffering vibration in backandforth directions or vibration in upanddown directions To this end the stabilizer bar bush comprises a rate plate of a circular pipe body shape in which an upper surface hole for feature adjustment is formed in a longitudinal direction along the upper surface thereof and a lower surface opening unit for feature adjustment is formed in the same direction as that of the upper surface hole for feature adjustment between both ends of the opposite side of the upper surface hole for feature adjustment an inner rubber which is formed along the inner surface of the rate plate and an outer rubber which is formed along the outer surface of the rate plate Here the inner rubber and the outer rubber are monolithically connected through the upper surface hole for feature adjustment and the lower surface opening unit for feature adjustment thereby reducing bearing stiffness in upanddown directions while increasing elasticity in upanddown directions
