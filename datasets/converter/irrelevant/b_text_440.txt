 CNB The invention provides a through inphase traction power supply system based on a fourport modular multilevel converter The system is formed by connecting traction buses of a plurality of through type inphase traction substations into contact networks which are communicated with one another and each through type inphase traction substation comprises two traction transformers T and T and a static power converter SPC with three input ports and one output port threephase primary side ports of T and T are connected with three phases of a synchronous public alternating current power gridthrough a circuit breaker threephase secondary side ports of T and T are connected with three input ports of an SPC respectively and an output port of the SPC is connected with a traction bus the SPC is formed by connecting k fourport modular multilevel converters PMMC in parallel each PMMC comprises four phases and each phase is formed by connecting an upper bridge arm and a lowerbridge arm in series the midpoints of the three phases of each PMMC are connected with the corresponding input ports of the SPC through threephase circuit breakers respectively and the midpointsof the fourth phases of each PMMC are connected with the output ports of the SPC through circuit breakers respectively The system has the advantages of canceling contact with wholenetwork electric splitphase being simple in substation traction transformer wiring being high in system equipment capacity utilization rate being flexible in configuration being high in reliability and being low in cost
