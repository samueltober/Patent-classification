 CNA     The invention provides a H switching control method for an automobile active suspension based on a TS fuzzy model The control method includes the following steps Step  Establish a TS fuzzy model of the active suspension Step  Propose an active suspension H control law based on the TS fuzzy model Step  Design a control switcher When the state is measurable the control switcher switches to the state feedback H controller when the state is undetectable it switches to the output feedback H controller The present invention has the following effects using the TS fuzzy model to describe the active suspension transforming the nonlinear suspension system into local linearity and combining the H controller with the TS fuzzy model to design the state feedback and output feedback control switching mechanism  Effectively improving the comfort and safety of the active suspension in complex road conditions
