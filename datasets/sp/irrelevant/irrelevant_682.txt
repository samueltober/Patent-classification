 CNU The utility model discloses a suspension system and a vehicle the suspension system comprises a torsion beam assembly a Panha rod a shock absorber and an antibending swing arm one end of the shock absorber is hinged to the torsion beam assembly and the other end of the shock absorber is used for being hinged to a vehicle body one end of the Panhalal rod is hinged to the torsion beam assembly and the other end of the Panhalal rod is hinged to the vehicle body one end of the antibending swing arm is welded to the torsion beam the other end of the antibending swing arm is hinged to the vehicle body the antibending swing arm and the shock absorber are both perpendicularly arranged relative to the torsion beam assembly and the antibending swing arm is perpendicular to the shockabsorber According to the utility model the first axis of the torsion beam assembly rotating relative to the wheel and the whole axis of the torsion beam assembly are arranged in a staggered mannerafter the torsion beam assembly is installed on a vehicle body the torsion beam assembly tends to be in a balanced state on the premise of bearing a certain load and when the suspension system needs to be changed to steer due to the fact that torque under the action of the certain load needs to be overcome the insufficient steering characteristic of the suspension system is optimized
