A resonant converter circuit comprises a multilevel inverter circuit placed before a resonant unit and the multilevel inverter circuit can reduce a voltage to be input to the resonant unit The reduced input voltage of the resonant unit results in a drop in an output voltage of the entire resonant converter circuit In this process the final output voltage is adjusted by adjusting the input voltage of the resonant unit with no need to substantially adjust a switching frequency of the resonant converter circuit
