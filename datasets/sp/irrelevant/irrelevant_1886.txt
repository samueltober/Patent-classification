 CNU     The utility model discloses an omnidirectional mobile robot chassis which includes a frame The frame includes an external pipe fitting and a builtin pipe fitting The side walls of a group of internal pipe fittings in the frame are respectively fixedly connected with mounting plates and the mounting plates on both sides are respectively fixed and connected A set of splints are rotatably connected to one end of the side wall by a shaft a set of flanges are rotatably connected between a set of splints through a bearing and a wheat wheel is fixedly connected to the adjacent end of the set of flanges and a set of splints are installed A shockabsorbing mechanism is arranged between the plates and a rotating motor is installed on the side wall of the outer end of the clamping plate on one side During the use of the device the shockabsorbing spring of the utility model can provide a buffer for the impact force generated during the movement thereby effectively avoiding the impact on the transported goods When the shockabsorbing spring is compressed there are two corresponding mounting plates at the front and rear The force received due to the existence of the support plate and the support tube will cancel each other and the existence of the support tube can reduce the deflection of the support plate
