PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To solve the problem that in a multilevel inverter if there is an individual difference between units a crossflow current may be generated thereby varying a current dutySOLUTION Voltage command value correction means is provided on a prestage of crossflow current suppression control means The voltage command value correction means includes first switch means for suppressing an approach of a voltage command value to zero by providing a threshold with respect to the voltage command value second switching means for inhibiting a change of the voltage command value from a negative value to a positive value when an inclination of a triangular carrier waveform is positive and third switch means for inhibiting a change of the voltage command value from a positive value to a negative value when the inclination of the triangular carrier waveform is negative The voltage command value that is corrected by the voltage command value correction means is defined as a voltage command value to the crossflow current suppression control meansSELECTED DRAWING Figure
