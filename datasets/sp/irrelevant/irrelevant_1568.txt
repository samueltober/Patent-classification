 CNU The upper connecting plate assembly of the riveting structure comprises a connecting plate supporting plates are fixedly hinged to the upper surface of the connecting plate through two first pin shafts respectively and a mounting plate is fixedly hinged to the top end of each supporting plate through a second pin shaft An inclined plate is fixedly hinged to the front face of each supporting plate through a third pin shaft symmetrical first sliding grooves are formed in the upper surface of the connecting plate sliding blocks are connected into the first sliding grooves in a clamped modethe upper surface of each sliding block is fixedly connected with the bottom face of the inclined plate a cavity is formed in the connecting plate and a sliding block is arranged in the cavity Symmetrical second sliding grooves are formed in the inner wall of the cavity According to the upper connecting plate assembly of the riveting structure the effect of secondarily buffering pressure is achieved the problem that the upper connecting plate assembly generates abnormal sound in the using process is solved the stability of the bearing plate in the vertical moving process is improved and the problem that loosening is caused by the unstable pressing process is solved
