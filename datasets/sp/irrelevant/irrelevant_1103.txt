 CNU The utility model relates to a suspension actuating mechanism and an active suspension device the suspension actuating mechanism is used for controlling wheels to move up and down and comprises a driving mechanism an actuating shaft and a swing arm the driving mechanism is connected with the actuating shaft and used for generating torque to drive the actuating shaft to rotate wherein one endof the swing arm is fixedly connected to the actuating shaft the other end of the swing arm is used for being connected with the wheel and when the actuating shaft rotates the swing arm is driven to rotate around the axis of the actuating shaft so that the wheel is driven to move up and down The actuating shaft is driven by the driving mechanism to rotate the swing arm is driven to rotate around the axis of the actuating shaft then the wheel is driven to move up and down and due to the fact that the swing arm mechanism is directly used for controlling the vertical position of the wheel the structure is simple the transmission efficiency is high and the control algorithm is simple
