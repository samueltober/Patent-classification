According to the new generation reaction water turbine an axial water flow channel of the water turbine is deliberately blocked water flow does not penetrate through a hole however selection of axial water flow passing through the water turbine is canceled and the phenomenon that energy conversion is carried out on the water flow at the shortest position of a lever power arm is changed waterflow in the water wheel can only pass through the longest place of the excircle lever power arm for water flow energy conversion a traditional propeller type impeller is a centrifugal water flow fourside conversion impeller ring which is radially rooted and permanently fixed on an axle and is composed of   and  centrifugal water flow fourside conversion impeller blades  are arranged on the edge of the circumference of a water wheel and the centrifugal water flow fourside conversion impeller blades  are distributed in an annular row The axial root is permanently fixed on a doublelayer side eave  on which a centrifugal water flow fourside conversion wheel blade  extends for  degrees in all directions and is blocked by the cavity cone of the axial water flow channel
