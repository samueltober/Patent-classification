 CNU An axle housing and a supporting shaft are welded to serve as a bearing component wheel edge assemblies are supported on the two sides of the axle housing a main speed reducer assembly is installed in the middle of the axle housing and the two sides of a half shaft are connected with the wheel edge assemblies and the main speed reducer assembly A tapered roller bearing  and a tapered roller bearing  are respectively mounted in an inner hole of the wheel shell to serve as an inner bearing and an outer bearing so that the bearing capacity is enhanced and the tapered roller bearing  and the tapered roller bearing  are supported on the supporting shaft through the two bearings wherein the axle housing is provided with an axle housing lug seat with an axle housing lug seat reinforcing rib the wall thickness of the axle housing lug seat reinforcing rib is mm and the axle housing lug seat reinforcing rib extends to the edge of a matching surface of the frame and the lug seat so as to meet the requirement of a heavyload working condition the inner gear ring is subjected to reverse modification during machining according to collected heat treatment deformation trend data during gear shaping it is guaranteed that a gear part is corrected after heat treatment to improve the precision and the problems that an existing wheel edge supporting bearing is insufficient in bearing capacity an axle housing lug base is prone to being broken under the heavyload working condition and the cracking failure rate of the inner gear ring is high are solved
