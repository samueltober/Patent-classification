The invention provides an adaptive cascade digital IO and analog signal collection circuit The adaptive cascade digital IO and analog signal collection circuit comprises a digital input circuit ananalog signal input circuit an analog power supply a digital power supply an ADC reference voltage circuit a RS interface circuit and a digital signal output circuit According to the circuit multiple digital input signals and analog input signals are collected at the same time and transmitted to an MCU module and digital signals are output through control of the MCU module The circuitsupports adaptive cascade adjustment and cascade work of one or more circuits is achieved During cascade work of the circuits the circuits communicate through a serial communication interface UARTof the MCU and the cascade sequence is adaptively identified a control signal is received and inquired the collected signal is transmitted to a circuit which is highest in priority and waits for query and control of an upper computer By means of the technical scheme the problems are solved that in the prior art when the digital input signals and the analog input signals are collected the system complexity is increased and the number of signal IO channels cannot be adaptively adjusted
