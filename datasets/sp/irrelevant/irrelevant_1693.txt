 CNA The invention is applicable to the technical field of robots and discloses a chassis for an automated guided vehicle and the automated guided vehicle The chassis for the automated guided vehicle comprises a base a driving mechanism a suspension mechanism a driving wheel a first driven wheel set and a second driven wheel set and the first driven wheel set and the second driven wheel set are arranged on the two opposite sides of the driving wheel respectively the suspension mechanism comprises a first suspension assembly and a second suspension assembly the driving mechanism and the first driven wheel set are suspended on the base through the first suspension assembly and the driving mechanism is in transmission connection with the driving wheel the second driven wheel set is hung on the base through a second hanging assembly and the end away from the second driven wheel set of the second suspension assembly is movably connected with the end away from the first driven wheel set of the first suspension assembly When the chassis for the automated guided vehicle encounters an obstacle or a pit the height of the base is kept unchanged the ground gripping effect of the driving wheels is good and the chassis is more stable and reliable when moving forwards and backwards
