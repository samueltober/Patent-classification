The invention discloses a kV active power distribution network based on power flow control nodes and a control method thereof A plurality of power flow control nodes are configured in a kV powerdistribution network two or more kV power distribution lines are connected through the power flow control nodes and active control over the power flow of the connected kV power distribution lines is achieved through series type ACDC converter devices in the power flow control nodes And the direct current sides of all the series type ACDC converter devices and the direct current sides of the parallel type ACDC converter devices are connected with the same direct current bus According to the invention the power flow of each kV line connected with the power flow control nodes can becontinuously and smoothly controlled the construction cost of a kV distribution network and even an upperlevel power transmission network can be reduced the line loss is reduced and the utilization rate and the power supply reliability of the line are improved
