 CNA The invention discloses a selfadaptive chassis system based on Mecanum wheels The system comprises Mecanum wheels a cross arm independent suspension an independent suspension mounting bracket an independent suspension mounting seat a central frame a selfadaptive chassis outer frame reinforcing ribs a weight reduction groove a connector an insertion hole a thrust bearing a fixed block a connecting carbon plate a first mounting hole a ball bearing a rotating piece a mounting groove and a second mounting hole Independent damping of each Mecanum wheel is guaranteed through independent suspension slight shaking is filtered out impact force during landing is buffered a parallelogram mechanism is utilized by the connecting rod device splayed deviation of the Mecanum wheels caused by factors such as gravity and vehiclemounted equipment is avoided and meanwhile the four wheels are integrally installed on a mutuallyinvolved selfadaptive chassis outer frame when one wheel is located on the higher horizontal plane the four wheels are kept to land at the same time through relative movement and adaptability of the Mecanum wheel to different grounds is improved
