 CNA The invention discloses a quality quantification and automatic multistage evaluation method based on threedimensional characteristics of a macrostructure of a steel casting blank The method comprises the following steps  obtaining the macrostructure of the section of the steel casting blank  measuring threedimensional characteristics an XY surface gray value and a Zaxis height valueof the section macrostructure  performing multiscale quantitative expression on quality information of different regions of the macrostructure and  carrying out automatic multistage judgmenton the macrostructure quality The method aims at the defects of segregation loosening and shrinkage cavities cracks and inclusions in a steel casting blank according to the method the threedimensional characteristics of the macrostructure section are integrated Dependence on macrostructure image quality can be reduced application objects are wider results are more accurate multiscale fine quantitative expression of quality information of a whole area or a specific position can be achieved automatic multilevel judgment of defects is achieved by constructing a relation equation ofdefect characteristic values and judgment levels and therefore the requirement for big data intelligent control is better met
