 DEB     Wheel suspension  for a steerable axle of a motor vehicle with two wheel carriers  opposite each other in the transverse direction of the vehicle each for rotatably receiving a wheel  each of which can be articulated via at least one wheelguiding handlebar  with a structure provided for this purpose a steering unit  which is connected to the two wheel carriers  and comprises a handlebar  extending in the transverse direction of the vehiclewhich is displaceable along its longitudinal axis  in such a way that the two wheel carriers  can be pivoted about a respective steering axis of rotation and with stabilizer means for roll stabilization so that when one of the two wheels  rebound and  or rebound the other wheel can be moved with it characterized in that the steering rod  forms at least part of a torsion bar stabilizer  and is rotatably mounted about its longitudinal axis  so that when one or both wheels  rebound and  or rebound the handlebar  can be rotated and  or twisted such that a torque generated by the rebounding and  or rebounding wheel  for roll stabilization on the other wheel  is transferable
