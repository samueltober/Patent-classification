 WOA The invention relates to a clutch device  for a chassis actuator  in particular of an adjustable roll stabilizer  for releasably connecting a drive shaft  to an output element  The invention is characterized by a clutch element  that is mounted on the drive shaft  and depending on the operating state of the drive shaft  can be axially moved between a transmission state active state in which the clutch element  assumes a frictional engagement with the output element  in order to establish a drive connection between the drive shaft  and the output element  and a decoupling state passive state in which the frictional engagement between the clutch element  and the output element  is released or at least reduced in order to drivingly decouple the output element  and the drive shaft  from each other
