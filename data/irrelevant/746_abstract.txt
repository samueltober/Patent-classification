The invention relates to an incremental distribution multiagent coordination optimization method which comprises the following steps of firstly obtaining basic data of an incremental distribution system and determining related investment operation risk index values of each investment agent of an incremental distribution network secondly comprehensively considering coordinated operation among the power distribution network the terminal comprehensive energy and the distributed power generation and establishing a multimainbody coordinated optimization model by taking maximization of economic benefits of incremental power distribution investment operation as a target under the constraint condition that three main bodies including the power distribution network the terminal comprehensive energy and the distributed power supply participate in incremental power distribution investment operation secondly evaluating the risk preference value of each main body based on a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method in combination with the related investment operation risk index of each investment main body and finally based on a risk assessment improved Shapley distribution method obtaining optimal configuration of incremental power distribution multiagent benefit allocation The method attracts different main body investments to operate the incremental power distribution network and improves the economy and operation efficiency of incremental power distribution network operation
