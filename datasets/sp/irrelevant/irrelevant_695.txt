 CNU A hydraulic cylinder is divided into an upper cavity and a lower cavity by a piston and a piston rod and a cylinder body of the hydraulic cylinder are respectively connected with an unsprung mass piece and an unsprung mass piece a suspension spring is arranged between the unsprung mass piece and the sprung mass piece one oil port of the twoway hydraulic pump is connected with one oil port of the electromagnetic valve the other oil port of the twoway hydraulic pump is connected with one oil port of the hydraulic cylinder and the other oil port of the electromagnetic valve is connected with the other oil port of the hydraulic cylinder an upper oil cavity of the hydraulic cylinder the twoway hydraulic pump the electromagnetic valve and a lower oil cavity of the hydraulic cylinder are communicated with one another through oil ways to form an internal space isolated from the atmosphere and the internal space is filled with oil or oilgas mixed liquid a rotor shaft of the motorgenerator is connected with a driving shaft of the bidirectional hydraulic pump and a winding of the motorgenerator is connected with the power electronic system The system is simple small in weight and size low in cost low in energy consumption safe reliable and the like and part of energy can be recycled in a timesharing mode
