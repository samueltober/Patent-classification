 JPA To obtain a hub unit bearing which can suppress an inner pressure change in an internal space for a long period of timeSOLUTION An opening of an internal space  of a hub unit bearing  in an axial direction is blocked by an outside sealing member  and an inside sealing member  All of seal lips a to c  a and b arranged at the outside sealing member  and the inside sealing member  are elongated to a direction progressing toward a downstream side from an upstream side with respect to a flowout direction of air when the air of the internal space  is leaked through a clearance between the seal lips a to c  a and b and mating slidecontact faces as progressing toward tip sides The inner pressure of the internal space  is adjusted to a value equal to or higher than atmospheric pressure by an inner pressure adjusting device SELECTED DRAWING Figure
