 JPA To achieve a higher frequency output voltage while suppressing a decrease in an effective output voltage value in a PWM control method of cellmultiplexed invertersSOLUTION A power conversion device  includes a cell multiplex inverter  in which cells consisting of singlephase inverters are connected in series in N N stages to each of three phases connected to a load and an inverter control unit  that controls onoff of a switching device of the singlephase inverter based on the comparison between N pieces of carriers and the voltage command of each phase The inverter control unit  calculates the maximum peak voltage Vp and does not limit the rate of change of the voltage command in a case of a withstand voltage Viso of the loadthe maximum peak voltage Vp while it limits the rate of change of the voltage command in a case of the withstand voltage Viso of the load
