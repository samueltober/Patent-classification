 CNB The invention discloses a structure and control parameter coordinating design method for a twostage vibration reduction type active suspension and belongs to the field of vehicle suspensions The method includes the steps that a dynamic model and a state space equation of the twostage vibration reduction type active suspension are constructed an H index equation which does not contain ideal control force soft constraint parameters is expressed by a state vector one control force soft constraint is added in the H index equation to form an H index equation containing ideal control forcesoft constraint parameters a suspension comprehensive performance index function is established wheel acceleration and springloading mass acceleration are obtained to be used as an output equationan integral control matrix is calculated an optimized objective function is established when the objective function is at the minimum value values of two structure parameters including the corresponding equivalent rigidity and the corresponding equivalent viscous damping of a bush spring and values of control parameters are coordinated and optimized design values and under the condition thatthe ideal electromagnetic control force and the dynamic disturbance degree of the bush spring are restrained by respective upper limit values the minimum suspension comprehensive performance index value is obtained
