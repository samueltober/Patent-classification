 CNB The invention relates to a hybrid multiterminal direct current power transmission line fault restart control method and device When direct current power transmission line fault restart is performeda constant direct voltage receiving terminal converter is switched to a constant direct current mode and a voltage reference value of the constant direct voltage receiving terminal converter is setto be zero After first set time the voltage reference value of the constant direct voltage receiving terminal converter is restored according to a set voltage slope a reverse current change rate isdetected and whether the reverse current change rate in a first set time period after the first set time is greater than a set change rate value is determined If the reverse current change rate isgreater than the set change rate value each terminal converter fault is controlled to be restarted If the reverse current change rate is not greater than the set change rate value a constant directvoltage receiving terminal restores the voltage reference value of the converter to a rated voltage Through increasing a size criterion of the reverse current change rate of the constant direct voltage receiving terminal the availability rate of a direct current power transmission system and the success rate of fault restart are improved and an overcurrent risk of an inverter side receiving terminal converter is reduced
