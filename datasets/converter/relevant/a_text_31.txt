 CNB The invention discloses a thermal stress balance predictive control method and system suitable for a multilevel converter and relates to a power electronic converter control technology The thermalstress balance predictive control method comprises the following steps firstly a cost function is constructed according to a control variable reference value and a control variable output predictionvalue and an optimal total output level and a level increment are determined secondly modules capable of acting are determined according to the level increment and finally a switch distributionfunction is designed according to the junction temperature value modules needing to act are determined and the level increment is distributed to the modules needing to act In the control method the cost function is designed according to the output prediction value and is not corrected and the output precision is ensured The switch distribution function is designed based on the junction temperature value for reflecting the thermal stress of each module the switching states of modules are determined through the switch distribution function and an effect of multimodule thermal stress balance is achieved
