 CNA The invention discloses a bearing antidisengagement structure and a hub reduction gear The bearing antidisengagement structure comprises a fixed piece a rotating piece a rotating bearing and an antiloose adjusting assembly The rotating piece sleeves the outer side of the fixed piece The rotating bearing is disposed between the fixed piece and the rotating piece and used for rotationally connecting the fixed piece with the rotating piece The antiloose adjusting assembly is disposed on the fixed piece and abuts against the rotating bearing The antiloose adjusting assembly is used foraxially adjusting the axial play of the rotating bearing and locking the rotating bearing By means of the technical scheme the axial play of the rotating bearing can be adjusted so that the rotating bearing has sufficient allowance in work for hot expansion and cold contraction and the failure of the rotating bearing can be prevented and the antiloose adjusting assembly can also lock the rotating bearing to prevent the connection failure of the rotating bearing so that the rotating piece and the fixed piece are more reliably connected
