 CNU The utility model discloses a multichannel lightning current information acquisition board card An analog lightning current signal acquired by taking a Rogowski coil as a sensor is converted into a digital signal the digital signal is transmitted to an FPFA in real time the highspeed data processing capacity of the FPGA is utilized an edge triggering and amplitude limiting comparison technology is adopted a triggering threshold is reduced meanwhile line clutter interference is filtered out and the lightning current signal is accurately judged an annular queue storing and sending technology is adopted to carry out delay output on digital signals loss of wave front data in lightning current information is avoided and complete lightning current waveforms generated in each return stroke discharging process are truly restored The multichannel lightning current information acquisition circuit adopts a board card level design development mode lightning current acquisition boardcards can be additionally arranged according to the actual situation of a site the number of monitoring channels is further increased meanwhile the multichannel lightning current acquisition board cards serve as maintainable units and can be replaced at any time the maintenance time is shortened and the maintainability of the system is improved
