 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of doubleaxle sanitation vehicle chassis and discloses a chassis structureof an electric rear doubleaxle sanitation vehicle The chassis structure comprises a chassis and rear axle connecting blocks are fixedly connected to the two sides of the rear end of the lower surface of the chassis According to the chassis structure of the electric rear doubleaxle sanitation vehicle when the load capacity of the electric sanitation vehicle is too large during operation a long plate spring bends to lower the chassis due to the facts that the arm of force of the long plate spring is longer the long plate spring shares a larger bearing surface and the bending effect of the long plate spring is better than that of a short plate spring the surface of an auxiliary wheel can be attached to the ground when the vehicle body sinks due to the facts that the radius of the auxiliary wheel is smaller than that of a driving wheel and the height of the lowest point of the long plate spring is the same as that of the lowest point of the short plate spring the auxiliary wheel can support the vehicle due to the fact that the bending effect of the short plate spring is poorer than that of the long plate spring and the contact area between the vehicle and the ground is increased and through interaction of a cushioning spring and a telescopic rod the vibration feeling generated by the cushioning spring can be effectively offset
