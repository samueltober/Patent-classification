 JPA To obtain a structure which can sufficiently secure the sealing performance of a fitting part between a fitting cylinder part of a cover and an internal peripheral face of an outer ring can easily apply rodwinding packaging to the cover and can make the attachment workability of the cover to the outer ring by a fixed delivery device favorableSOLUTION An elastic member a has an inside inclination face part  arranged substantially in parallel with an outside inclination face part a of an outer ring a and closely facing the outside inclination face part a Then a labyrinth seal  which is inclined to a direction progressing toward the outside of a radial direction as progressing toward the inside of an axial direction is constituted between the outside inclination face part a and the inside inclination face part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
