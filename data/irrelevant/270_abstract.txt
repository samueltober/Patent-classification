Current sensing in an ondie direct currentdirect current DCDC converter for measuring delivered power is disclosed A DCDC converter converts input voltage to output current at an output voltage coupled to a load circuit The DCDC converter includes a high side driver HSD circuit to drive the output current in a first stage and a low side driver LSD circuit to couple the power output to a negative supply rail GND in a second phase output current being periodic The DCDC converter includes an amplifier circuit to equalize an output voltage and a mirror voltage Based on the mirror voltage the current sensing circuit generates mirror current that corresponds to driver current The mirror current can be measured as a representation of the output current delivered to the load circuit A plurality of the DCDC converters can provide multiphased current to the load circuit for providing power to the load circuit
