 CNA     A method for controlling the damping characteristics of a vehicle shock absorber in an active or semiactive suspension system especially for compensating for changes in the operating temperature of the shock absorber is described including a plurality of adjustable damping shock absorbers  A sensor designed to detect the relative vertical acceleration or relative vertical movement between the vehicle body and each wheel associated with the shock absorber and an electronic processing and control unit designed to issue a drive for the shock absorber control valve Signal to achieve the predetermined damping characteristic of the shock absorber Compensation for changes in the operating temperature of the shock absorber is carried out by Estimating the mechanical power dissipated in the heat by the shock absorber Estimating the thermal power exchanged by the shock absorber with the environment As the dissipated mechanical power and the environment The function of the exchanged heat power evaluates the current operating temperature of the shock absorber andaccording to the shock absorber reference model to control the drive current of the control valve of the shock absorber to reach the operating point corresponding to the predetermined nominal damping force of the shock absorber The model indicates the relationship between the damping force of the shock absorber the operating temperature of the shock absorber and the drive current of the control valve
