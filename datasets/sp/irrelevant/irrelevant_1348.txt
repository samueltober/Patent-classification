 KRB The present invention relates to a carbon fiber or a CNT composite material and a suspension bearing for a midsize car without an insert using the same which can reduce the weight of a product while providing excellent performance by providing desired performance without installing an insert inside a body housing of a body is friendly can significantly improve impact resistance tensile strength and impact strength and can reduce specific gravity by injectionmolding the housing with a mixture in which PA is mixed with a carbon fiber composite material or a CNT composite material shorten a process time maximize production volume and reduce work costs significantly by manufacturing the body a sealing body and a damper through a series of processes through third injection molding and can completely block the inflow of foreign matter and moisture from the outside by the sealing body by installing the sealing body between the body and the damper through secondary injection molding
