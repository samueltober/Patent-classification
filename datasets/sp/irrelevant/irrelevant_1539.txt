 CNU The suspension system comprises a connecting main pin and a sliding guide rail wheels are arranged at the two ends of the connecting main pin a first bearing arm and a second bearing arm are sequentially arranged on the surface of the connecting main pin and located on the inner sides of the wheels in a sleeving mode and the sliding guide rail is arranged on a vehicle body One side of the sliding guide rail is slidably connected with a negative pressure damping cylinder and one end of the first bearing arm and one end of the second bearing arm are rotatably connected with the two ends ofthe negative pressure damping cylinder respectively According to the suspension system for generating power by using the dead weight of the new energy automobile kinetic energy which floats up and down and is generated by suspension in the driving process of the automobile is transmitted to the negativepressure damping cylinder through the two bearing arms and the kinetic energy can be transmitted to the power generation device through the transmission piece while vibration is absorbed and buffered through the negativepressure damping cylinder mechanical energy is converted into electricenergy through the power generation device to be used by an automobile the mechanical energy generated by floating of the automobile is greatly utilized and energy conservation and environmental protection are better achieved
