 CNB The invention provides a harmonic suppression method for an output voltage of a cascaded electric energy treatment device and belongs to the technical field of control of power electronic devices The method is applied to the cascaded electric energy treatment device An outlet of the cascaded electric energy treatment device directly supplies power to a load after voltage reduction in order tosuppress output voltage harmonics especially harmonics under a nonlinear load of the cascaded electric energy treatment device a resonance regulator is connected to a traditional PI regulator in parallel and the resonance regulator is dynamically changed according to a harmonic content of an output current monitored in real time According to the method the harmonic content of the output voltage can be effectively suppressed a control method is simple an existing circuit topology does not need to be changed only corresponding circuits need to be added and engineering implementation iseasy
