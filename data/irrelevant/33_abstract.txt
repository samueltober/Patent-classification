The present invention relates to a method and system for fault positioning and recovery of a voltage source converter The method comprises locking a converter station when it is detected that an alternatingcurrent voltage contains a zero sequence voltage or a directcurrent voltage contains an unbalanced voltage positioning a fault by continuing to detect the zero sequence voltage of an alternatingcurrent side of the converter and recovering the operation of each station after the fault is positioned The method for fault positioning and recovery is simple and practical has high reliability and can effectively detect the problems that each station contains a zero sequence voltage of an alternatingcurrent side and cannot easily position a fault caused due to the fact that the zero sequence voltage of the alternatingcurrent side is transmitted by a voltage source converter to an oppositeside alternatingcurrent system meanwhile by means of the recovery method a nonfaulty converter station can get rid of the influences of a faulty converter station for rapid recovery rapid recovery based on a voltage source converter station system is implemented and the application of a transformerless wiring method in the voltage source converter can be promoted thereby finally achieving that the occupied space of a converter station is reduced losses are reduced and manufacture costs are reduced
