This application proposes an adaptive droop control strategy suitable for multiterminal flexible DC transmission systems It detects the active power value of the converter station in real time and adjusts the droop coefficient of the converter station according to the active power value of the converter station When the converter station absorbs more active power the converter station should reserve more power adjustment margin to prevent its power from reaching the upper limit and losing its power adjustment ability which can effectively suppress the DC voltage deviation and effectively improve the multiterminal flexible DC transmission system Operational reliability and fault tolerance and can effectively solve the contradiction between traditional strategies in power distribution and voltage deviation control and can improve the power oscillation problem during system state switching
