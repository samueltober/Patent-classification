 CNU     The utility model relates to the technical field of suspension reinforcement devices in particular to a barn grid type air suspension reinforcement device The technical problem to be solved by the utility model is that the length cannot be adjusted and the pressure cannot be adjusted In order to solve the above technical problems the utility model provides a barngrid air suspension reinforcement device The utility model is mainly composed of a telescopic mechanism and a supporting mechanism The first fixed frame and the threaded rod can adjust the lateral length of the device The device can be adapted to the wheelbase of different vehicle models and it is easy to operate and easy to install thereby solving the problem of the existing device needing to replace the reinforcement device and reducing the production efficiency The second support plate is provided to replace the existing connecting rod At the same time under the action of the hydraulic components and hydraulic telescopic rods inside the support mechanism the device can adapt to the pressure to adjust the second support plate under different pressures so that it will not break or limit suspension due to pressure changes The work effect of the frame
