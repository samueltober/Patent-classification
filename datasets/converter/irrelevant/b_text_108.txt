 CNB The invention discloses a regional energy interconnected distribution network system based on a power routing technology Regional power routers variablevoltage power routers and branch power routers serving as core node devices are networked hierarchically to form a regional energy interconnected distribution network composed of an interconnected centralized control layer a variablevoltage separate control layer and an interface extension layer which are distributed in a centralized manner and combined The regional power routers are accessed into a traditional distribution network through a mediumvoltage special line or a feed line to carry out ACDC conversion to form mediumvoltage AC and mediumvoltage DC ring networks The variablevoltage power routers are connected to mediumvoltage AC and mediumvoltage DC buses through mediumvoltage AC and DC grid interfaces and have the ability of ACDC energy conversion and voltage transformation AC and DC interfaces classified by function are formed on the lowvoltage side and the lowvoltage AC and DC interfaces are extended through the branch power routers The power routers are networked hierarchically and accessed into thetraditional distribution network The permeability of distributed clean power generation can be further enhanced and the requirements of different users for flexibility and power supply reliabilityare satisfied
