 TRA The invention relates to a modular power converter that can be used in cylindrical systems such as underwater torpedoes and whose subcomponents are placed in such a way as to provide effective volume usage and functionality The power converter to be used in the motor drive application in question contains a circular supply four DClink capacitors six power transistor modules in total one for each phase that provide power conversion and a card module that controls the power converted by the inverter structure By positioning the power transistor modules in the form of a hexagonal ring on the inner wall of the case these modules are placed as far from the center as possibleThus more efficient distribution of the heat generated in the unit is achieved
