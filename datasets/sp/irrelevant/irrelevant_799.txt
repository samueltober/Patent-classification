 CNA The invention discloses a multistage nonindependent suspension system which comprises two sets of suspension structures and a middle supporting piece Each set of suspension structure comprises at least two stages of suspensions two firststage suspensions of the two sets of suspension structures are connected through the middle supporting piece a transition structure with a guiding function is installed between every two adjacent stages of suspensions of each set of suspension structure and two laststage suspensions of the two sets of suspension structures are connected with a rack Rigidity of elastic elements of different stages of suspensions is different to a certain extent and upward jumping and downward jumping of a driving wheel are achieved through combination of the multiple stages of suspensions According to the multistage nonindependent suspension system guide mechanisms are allowed to have a certain swing angle and are limited to swing in one direction and effective contact between the driving wheel and the ground can be guaranteed By means of the multistage suspension structure the overall height of a wheeled robot can be kept unchanged or slightly changed under the noload condition and the heavyload condition and therefore the wheeled robot can be directly submerged into lowbottom equipment such as cars and tool cars and the multistage nonindependent suspension system can be particularly used for ultrathin wheeled robots
