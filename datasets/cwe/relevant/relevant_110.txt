 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a structure of a seal ring which can inexpensively obtain the seal ring capable of securing the sealing performance of an intermediate portion between an axial outer end face of an outer ring and the seal ringSOLUTION An outward flange part a which is arranged in a state of being bent to the outside of a radial direction from a fixed cylinder part a which is internally fixed to an outer end part of an outer ring a in an axial direction out of a core grid a constituting a seal ring a is constituted of a flat plate part  a bent part  which is curvedly bent to a direction progressing to a single direction in the axial direction as progressing toward the outside of the radial direction and an inclined plate part  which is inclined to a direction progressing to the single direction of the axial direction as progressing toward the outside of the radial direction sequentially from the inside of the radial direction A salient part a which is salient to the inside of the axial direction is formed at an inside diameter side end part of a back face cover part  being a part of seal material a covering an inside face of the outward flange part a in the axial direction Furthermore the salient part a and a boundary position X of the other side face of the flat plate part  in the axial direction and the other side face of the bent part  in the axial direction are superimposed on each other in the axial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
