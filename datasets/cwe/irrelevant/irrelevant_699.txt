 CNU The utility model discloses a hub with high protectiveness which comprises a hub body the outer surface of the hub body is coated with a coating layer the coating layer comprises a wearresistant layer a first corrosionresistant layer a flameretardant layer a hightemperatureresistant layer and a second corrosionresistant layer the wearresistant layer is positioned on the outer surface of the first corrosionresistant layer the flameretardant layer is positioned on the outer surface of the second corrosionresistant layer and the second corrosionresistant layer is positioned on the outer surface of the second corrosionresistant layer The first corrosionresistant layer is located on the outer surface of the flameretardant layer the flameretardant layer is located on the outer surface of the hightemperatureresistant layer the hightemperatureresistant layer is located on the outer surface of the second corrosionresistant layer the wearresistant layer is a ceramic polymer coating the first corrosionresistant layer is an epoxy resin coating the flameretardant layer is an acrylate flameretardant threeproofing coating and the second corrosionresistant layer is an epoxy resin coating And the hightemperatureresistant layer is an organic silicon ceramic glass coating Through mutual cooperation of the wearresistant layer the first corrosionresistant layer the flameretardant layer the hightemperatureresistant layer and the second corrosionresistant layer the problems that an existing hub is not high in protectiveness and is prone to being corroded by external substances in the using process and therefore the service life is short are solved
