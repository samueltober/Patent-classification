 DEB An active suspension in which a nozzle plate  is mounted between an insulator  and a membrane  to divide an interior space into an upper liquid chamber  and a lower liquid chamber   and a encapsulated hydraulic fluid flows from the nozzle plate through a first flow path  in response to a change in the connection state of the liquid chambers the active suspension comprising the nozzle plate having a second flow path  spaced from the first flow path  and allows the upper liquid chamber  and the lower liquid chamber   to communicate with each other the diaphragm  made of a material having elasticity and a lower portion of the nozzle plate  is connected to form the lower liquid chamber   the membrane  having a bent portion which is arranged so that it is in direct contact with a lower surface of the nozzle plate and a yoke that has a body portion a which has a cup shape and has an upper end in close contact with a lower portion of the bent portion and a rod portion b which is connected to a lower portion of the body portion a the yoke being arranged to be magnetized when electric power is applied to a coil  disposed adjacent to the yoke the lower liquid chamber   is divided into a first lower liquid chamber  which is arranged outside the bend section and is in communication with the first flow path  and a second lower liquid chamber  which is arranged inside the bend section and in connection with the second flow path  and metallic pieces  are connected to a section  of the membrane  which is used as an inn er portion of the bend portion is defined to form the second lower liquid chamber  so that when the yoke is magnetized the elastic behavior of the section  is restricted characterized in that the pieces  are arranged so that they form several rows on the lower surface and the outer peripheral surface of the section
