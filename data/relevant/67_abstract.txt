This application relates to a method for suppressing capacitance voltage fluctuations of a fullbridge MMC submodule including obtaining the AC side current amplitude of the fullbridge MMC and according to the AC side current amplitude power factor angle and submodules of the fullbridge MMC Capacitor voltage fluctuation component model to obtain the theoretically required circulating current value obtain the instantaneous value of the upper bridge arm current the instantaneous value of the lower bridge arm current and the instantaneous value of the DC current of the fullbridge MMC and calculate the actual circulating current value of the fullbridge MMC Calculate the difference between the theoretical required circulating current value and the actual circulating current value generate a reference voltage according to the difference inject the reference voltage into the fullbridge MMC and generate the required circulating current in each phase after modulation and fluctuate the capacitor voltage of each submodule Suppress The foregoing fullbridge type MMC submodule capacitor voltage fluctuation suppression method can inject a corresponding reference voltage according to the actual circulating current value which is beneficial to improve the submodule capacitor voltage fluctuation suppression effect
