 JPA To obtain a combination seal ring which can hold a magnetic fluid having sufficient density and a volume necessary for securing sealing performance for a long period of timeSOLUTION Clearances between a slinger  and a seal ring  constituting a combination seal ring a are sealed with a first magnetic fluid seal  and a second magnetic fluid seal  respectively The first magnetic fluid seal  is formed by holding a first magnetic fluid  which is obtained by mixing magnetic powder with a solvent over an entire periphery of a first approximate opposing part  by a magnetic force of an annular magnetization part  and the second magnetic fluid seal  is formed by holding a second magnetic fluid  which is obtained by mixing the magnetic powder with the solvent over an entire periphery of a second approximate opposing part  by the magnetic force of the annular magnetization part  As the solvent constituting the first magnetic fluid  there is employed a waterbase solvent and as the solvent constituting the second magnetic fluid  there is employed an oilbase solventSELECTED DRAWING Figure
