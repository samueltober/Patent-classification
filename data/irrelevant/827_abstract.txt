The invention discloses a split power unitbased topological structure of a multilevel converter and a control strategy The topological structure comprises three bridge arms a b and c which are completely the same in structure each of the bridge arms a b and c comprises a head module preceding stage N  power generationenergy storage units N split power generationenergy storage power modules and a head module backward stage the first module preceding stages of the bridge arms a b and c are connected with the first power generationenergy storage unit the N power generationenergy storage units are sequentially connected with the N split power generationenergy storage power modules at intervals the first module backward stages are connected with the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the electrolytic capacitor of the Nth power generationenergy storage unit the first module backward stages of the bridge arms a b and c are mutually connected According to the split power unitbased topological structure of the multilevel converter and the control strategy of the invention a switching mode is reasonably arranged so that the switching frequency is minimized
