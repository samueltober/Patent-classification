 CNB The invention discloses a feedback energy suspension device which comprises a rack a small gear shaft an electric generator a guide bar an inner cylinder and an elastic component wherein a gear part of the small gear shaft is meshed with the rack a shaft stretching end of the small gear shaft is connected to the electric generator the rack is inserted into the guide bar the guide bar is fixed in the inner cylinder the rack is a cylindrical rack and the elastic component sleeves exterior of the inner cylinder When an automobile runs onto a raised part or runs out from a pit an axle will move closer to the automobile body the rack is compressed to move downwards the small gear shaft is driven to rotate and further rotation of the electric generator can be driven When the automobile runs into the pit or leaves the raised part the axle moves away from the automobile body the rack is drawn to move upwards and the small gear shaft is driven to rotate and thus rotation of the electric generator in the reverse direction can be driven The feedback energy suspension device is characterized in that updown reciprocating motion of a suspension is transformed into rotary motion of the electric generator and energy sources can be recycled through electric generation of the electric generator In this way consumption of the energy sources can be reduced and energy consumption of the automobile can be reduced
