In an uninterruptible power supply apparatus in a power failure of a commercial AC power supply a switch is turned off to electrically cut off the commercial AC power supply from an AC input filter and a DC voltage converter is controlled such that a DC voltage that is the difference between terminaltoterminal voltages of first and second capacitors is eliminated and when the DC voltage exceeds a threshold voltage a converter is controlled to reduce the DC voltage
