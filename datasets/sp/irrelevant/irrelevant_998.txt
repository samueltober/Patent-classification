 CNB The invention discloses a vibration reduction automobile body for improving the NVH performance of an automobile One end of a cap mounted on a front vibration reduction component is butted with a framework front driving vibration reduction disc of a frame an arcshaped plate is used for fixing a cross beam at the upper part of the front framework of the frame and the installation of other partsis not in the scope of the invention When the road is uneven after two sets of tires of the front vibration reduction component are stressed the force can be transmitted to a fixed head and an upper connecting rod secondly part of the force is directly transmitted through brake discs in the two sets of tires of the front vibration reduction component the upper connecting rod is controlled to swing up and down a swing head welded to the top end of the upper connecting rod is used for being rotationally connected with an opening clamping block so that the two sets of tires slightly moveup and down after being stressed the vibration reduction effect is achieved and a twoway supporting rod frame connected with the opening clamping block at the finallystressed position can guide the force into the automobile body and counteract the force through the gravity of the automobile body
