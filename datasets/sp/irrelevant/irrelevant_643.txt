 CNA The invention discloses a double linear motor energyfeeding active suspension actuator and a control method thereof An actuator body comprises an actuator outer shell a base a rod a sixphase flux linkage linear motor and a threephase permanent magnet synchronous linear motor The control system comprises an active control system and an energy recovery system The invention also discloses anendocrine compound PID control method The two linear motors in different structural forms are combined into a whole active thrust of the suspension system is provided by the sixphase flux linkagelinear motor the threephase permanent magnet synchronous linear motor is in an energyfeeding state to recover vibration energy Space is greatly compressed by integration of the two linear motors in different structural forms meanwhile energy feeding and active control are integrated the vehicle suspension system is in an optimal vibration damping state while energy is recovered and smoothness and operation stability of vehicles are improved
