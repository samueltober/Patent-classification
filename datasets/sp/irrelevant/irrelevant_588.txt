 CNU The utility model discloses a novel structure of a vehicle body mounting bracket casting Casting body the structure has the advantages that the connection strength is high bearing capacity is strong processing and forming are simple easy precision assurance the strength of the whole rear torsion beam assembly can be improved reliability and carrying capacity the structure of an existing product is optimized the use quantity of sand molds can be reduced during casting casting process simplification when the optimized product is cast the use of a sand core is reduced therefore thecore setting time is shortened therefore the production efficiency of the whole production line is improved during casting a sand core is not needed the use of the sand core is avoided core boxes for manufacturing the sand core are reduced the production cost is greatly reduced the waste of resources is reduced energy conservation and emission reduction are achieved product scrap causedby poor sand core is avoided meanwhile flashes formed by an external sand core are avoided and the appearance of a casting is more attractive
