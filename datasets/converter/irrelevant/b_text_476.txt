 CNA The invention relates to the field of new energy automobiles in particular to a vehiclemounted noninductive tracking photoelectric and photothermal integrated system In the current market because a vehiclemounted photoelectric and photothermal system is not capable of chasing the sun the power generation and heat collection efficiency is low and the problem of ranges of new energy vehicles cannot be solved Moreover the technology of optoelectronic and photothermal integration is not enough in the market so that a technical problem existing in the optoelectronic and photothermalindustry and needing to be urgently addressed in the photoelectric and photothermal industry is arisen ie under the current background that the photoelectricity conversion rate is difficult to improve effectively within a short period of time a vehiclemounted photoelectric and photothermal system can chase the sun and is practical as well According to the vehiclemounted noninductive tracking photoelectric and photothermal integrated system a vehiclemounted photovoltaic charging system and a onedimension or twodimension noninductive optoelectronic and photothermal tracking system is constructed the technical problem is well solved and the power generation and heat collecting efficiency of the vehiclemounted noninductive tracking photoelectric and photothermal integrated system is increased by about  on average
