 CNU The hub bearing unit sealing element comprises a first framework and a second framework a rubber sealing body is arranged on the first framework a lip portion is arranged on the rubber sealing bodythe lip portion is matched with the second framework to form a water storage space and the water storage space is communicated with the outside through a labyrinth type sealing channel The water storage space is mainly used for accumulating water or impurities entering from the outside and preventing the water or the impurities from directly entering the hub bearing and the water storage spaceplays a role in buffering The water storage space is communicated with the outside through the labyrinth sealing channel outside water or impurities are not prone to entering the water storage space and the water or the impurities located in the water storage space in the rotating process of the hub bearing are discharged along the labyrinth sealing channel under the action of centrifugal force The water storage tank is mainly used for storing water or impurities and preventing the water or the impurities from entering the labyrinth type sealing channel so as to optimize the sealing performance of the sealing piece
