 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To suppress plastic deformation when fitting a slinger to a hub shaft in a wheel bearing deviceSOLUTION A wheel bearing device  includes a hub shaft  having a flange part  an outer ring  a plurality of rolling elements  an annular seal member  and an annular slinger  with which the seal member  comes into slide contact The slinger  includes a cylindrical part  fitted to the hub shaft  in a fastened and fitted state a disc part  arranged along a side surface a at a vehicle inner side of the flange part  and an annular intermediate part  provided between the cylindrical part  and the disc part  The intermediate part  includes a first inclined part  bent at a boundary with the cylindrical part  and a second inclined part  bent at a boundary with the disc part  An inclination angle  with respect to an inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical part  in the first inclined part  is set to be larger than an inclination angle  with respect to a side surface on a vehicle outer side of the disc part  in the second inclined part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
