 CNU The utility model discloses a wheel flange plate Flange plate main body a plurality of bolt holes are formed in the flange plate main body bolts are arranged in the bolt holes in a penetrating mode Bolt comprising a bolt head the whole bolt head is cylindrical and one side of the bolt head is cut to form an antirotation surface protrusions are arranged on the flange plate body the protrusion is located on the side edge of the bolt head and the side facing the antirotation face of the protrusion is a limiting face opposite to the antirotation face The antirotation surface is inantirotation fit with the limiting surface a fixing structure is arranged on the face opposite to the flange plate body of the bolt head after the bolt is pressed into the bolt hole the antirotation face and the limiting face are in antirotation fit the protrusion can prevent the bolt from rotating the slipping moment of the bolt can be increased without increasing the fit interference between the bolt and the bolt hole and the deformation amount of the flange plate body in actual use is reduced
