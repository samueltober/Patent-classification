The invention discloses an active power router with an ACDC throughfault function comprising a highvoltage rectifierlevel MMCACDC modular multilevel converterACDC converter connected with ahighvoltage AC distribution network of an ACDC distribution network via a highvoltage AC port and a rectifierlevel MMCACDC converter and a transformer isolatorlevel MMCDCDC converter both connected with a highvoltage DC distribution work of a highvoltage DC port A lowvoltage DC port of the transformer isolatorlevel MMCDCDC converter is connected with the DC side of a threephaseDCAC converter to form a lowvoltage DC interface a lowvoltage AC port of the threephase DCAC converter may be connected with a lowvoltage AC grid or a singlephasethreephase AC load The highvoltage side of the active power router is composed of a hybrid submodule with negative level output giving the ACDC throughfault capacity and ensuring that the power router can run uninterruptibly and reliably when an external ACDC grid fails power generation penetration rate of a distributed clean energy and reliability of power supply can be further improved
