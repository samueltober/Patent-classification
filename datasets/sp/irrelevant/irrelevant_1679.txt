 CNA The invention relates to the technical field of vehicles in particular to a guide structure a vehicle suspension and a vehicle The guide structure comprises a rolling part and a mounting part and the rolling part is suitable for making contact with a rod body of a piston rod of the shock absorber to form rolling friction and rotates around the axis of the rolling part under the action of rolling friction force when the piston rod does reciprocating motion and the mounting part is connected with the rolling part and is suitable for being fixed at the upper part of a cylinder barrel of the shock absorber According to the guide structure on the premise that the internal structure of the shock absorber and the arrangement form of the suspension are not changed abrasion of the sealing ring on the upper portion of the cylinder barrel of the shock absorber is effectively avoided the service life of the shock absorber is prolonged the motion resistance of the piston rod is reduced the shock absorber gives full play to the shock absorption effect and the comfort of the whole vehicle is improved
