 JPB To provide a method for manufacturing a hub unit capable of enhancing machining efficiency of a caulking partSOLUTION A hub ring  is arranged so that a central axis of the hub ring  is coaxial or parallel to a reference axis C in a state where the hub ring  is supported so as to be movable in a radial direction a force plunger  having an autorotation axis  inclined with respect to the reference axis C is pressed against an axially inside end part of the hub ring  and the force plunger  is rotated around the reference axis C so that the axially inside end part of the hub ring  is machined into a caulking part SELECTED DRAWING Figure
