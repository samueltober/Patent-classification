 CNU The utility model discloses a novel mediumhigh voltage frequency conversion speed regulation system without transformer isolation and belongs to a mediumhigh voltage frequency conversion speed regulation technology and a control technology realization scheme thereof According to the scheme a power frequency transformer used by a traditional mediumhigh voltage frequency converter and a highfrequency isolation DCDC conversion link in a new generation of mediumhigh voltage frequency converter based on a cascaded multilevel converter without the power frequency transformer are omitted and each phase of cascaded rectifier in the scheme forms a pair of common mediumhigh voltage direct current buses the inverter circuit can be directly connected with a diode clamping type inverter circuit or a capacitor clamping type inverter circuit moreover the frequency converter does not need electrical isolation and electrical isolation among threephase inverters is realized by using thethreephase stator winding of the AC motor thereby greatly reducing the size and weight of the frequency converter greatly reducing the system structure and control complexity of the mediumhigh voltage frequency converter and greatly reducing the operation process loss and hardware cost of the mediumhigh voltage frequency converter Meanwhile the system reliability and the overall efficiencyare greatly improved and the system is particularly suitable for the field of mediumhigh voltage highpower frequency conversion speed regulation
