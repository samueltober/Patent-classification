 JPA To provide an elastic body bush etc which can change a movable range in a specific directionSOLUTION An elastic body bush  includes a first cylindrical body  attached to a first member  a second cylindrical body  attached to a second member B in a such a way so as to enable relative displacement in an axial direction and inserted into the inner diameter side of the first cylindrical body an elastic body  provided between an inner peripheral surface of the first cylindrical body and an outer peripheral surface of the second cylindrical body a pair of displacement restriction members   which are attached to the second member are provided facing both axial end parts of the first cylindrical body and restrict axial maximum displacement of the first cylindrical body relative to the second member and a driving device  which changes a space between the displacement restriction members to change the maximum displacementSELECTED DRAWING Figure
