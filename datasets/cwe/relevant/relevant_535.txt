 CNA The invention belongs to the technical field of automobile hub bearings and discloses a method a device and equipment for determining the magnitude of interference of a hub bearing unit and a storage medium The method comprises the following steps determining the minimum magnitude of interference according to the radial load the inner diameter the effective width and the radial rated staticload according to the equivalent outer diameter of the inner ring the diameter of the matching surface the equivalent inner diameter of the inner flange shaft the elastic modulus the fracture limit of the quenched inner ring and the quenched inner flange shaft and the safety coefficient determining the maximum magnitude of interference correcting the maximum magnitude of interference and the minimum magnitude of interference According to the corrected minimum interference magnitude and the corrected maximum interference magnitude the interference magnitude range of the hub bearing unit is determined By means of the mode the reasonable interference magnitude range of the hub bearing unit can be determined the produced hub bearing unit is located in the reasonable interference magnitude range and loosening and cracking of an inner ring of the hub bearing unit are avoided
