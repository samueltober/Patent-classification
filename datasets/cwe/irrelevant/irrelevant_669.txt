 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of intelligent driving equipment in particular to a wheel type alldrive chassis A driving module of the wheeltype alldrive chassis comprises two driving modules each driving module comprises two driving wheels and a driving motor providing driving force for the two driving wheels the driving motors are located between the two driving wheels each driving wheel is connected with a first synchronous wheel the driving motors are connected with a second synchronous wheel and the first synchronous wheel and the second synchronous wheel are connected with the driving modules The second synchronous wheel is connected with the two first synchronous wheels on the two sides through a transmission device According to the scheme four driving wheels are adopted and two driving motors are used for driving Therefore the chassis with the structure has high stability in the movement process the mobile equipment can run more smoothly and stably the phenomena of slipping drifting and instability of movement control in the movement process of the chassis are eradicated and the production cost is low
