 USA A driver for a circuit with a capacitive load includes a power converter configured to receive a DC input voltage from an input stage generate a switching voltage at a switching node and output an output voltage forming an analog waveform at an output stage The power converter includes a first switch connected between an inductive device and a ground a second switch connected between the inductive device and the output stage and a controller to control the first switch and the second switch The analog waveform has an amplitude at least two times greater than the input voltage
