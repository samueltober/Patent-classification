The invention belongs to the technical field of power electronics and specifically relates to a softstart method for power electronic transformers based on energy feedback The method includes after obtaining the highvoltage DC side voltage analyzing the relationship between the peak inductor current and the internal shift ratio and designing The increased trajectory compared to the internal shift in response to the inrush current that occurs when CHB is converted from uncontrollable rectification to PWM rectification a lowvoltage side energy feedback control strategy is invented which uses DAB bidirectional power flow characteristics to return part of the lowvoltage DC side energy to On the highvoltage side make the highvoltage side voltage reach the closedloop reference value to eliminate the inrush current that occurs when CHB is connected to the grid and complete the soft start of the power electronic transformer the startup strategy of the present invention makes the highvoltage side voltage reach the closedloop reference before entering the closedloop control Value eliminates the AC side impact current generated at the moment when the PET is connected to the grid
