 WOA A ball joint comprises a body of a joint  where there is inserted a pin  having a longitudinal axis and including a first threaded end  and a second spherical end  the latter being rotatably arranged within a seat  of said body  and being able to cooperate with a first sphericalcapshaped element or shell  inserted within a seat having a corresponding shape of a second sphericalcapshaped element or shell  cooperating with a covering element  so as to close the spherical end  of the pin  within said body  the second spherical end  of the pin  and the first and second shells including pairs of recesses   and ridges   in the contact areas suitable for reciprocally compenetrating said pairs of recesses and ridges being arranged at  to each other so as to allow the rotation of the pin  along all axes in the space X Y Z an angular movement sensor  integral with said body of the joint  being provided suitable for cooperating with the second element or shell  so as to detect the rotation of the pin  around said axis containing the longitudinal axis of the pin itself
