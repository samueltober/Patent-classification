 CNA The invention belongs to the field of directcurrent transformers particularly relates to a cascaded directcurrent transformer and a control method thereof and aims to solve the problems that internal parameters of converters serving as power units of the directcurrent transformer are different so that the voltage of a highvoltage side capacitor is diffused and the transformer cannot operate normally The cascaded directcurrent transformer comprises N isolated DCDC power conversion units and N voltagesharing units the voltagesharing unit is embedded among the N highvoltage side Hbridge units of the N isolated DCDC power conversion units in a cascaded manner and the lowvoltage sides of the N isolated DCDC power conversion units are connected in parallel Each isolatedDCDC power conversion unit comprises a highfrequency transformer three Hbridge units and corresponding bus capacitors The voltage equalization of the isolated DCDC power conversion unit is realized through the voltage equalization unit the divergence phenomenon of the highvoltage side capacitor voltage is avoided and the operation stability of the cascaded DC transformer is ensured
