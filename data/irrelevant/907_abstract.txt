The invention discloses a highvoltage resistant LDO linear power supply realized by a lowvoltage MOSFET MOSFET withstand voltage limit voltage to the lowvoltage multistage gain enhancement module and the control voltage of the output power supply module the lowvoltage multistage gain enhancement module outputs the highgain voltage to the highvoltage drive module the highvoltage drive module converts the input voltage into current and then into The high voltage is output to the power supply module the power supply module is connected to the output end of the power supply the voltage clamp module extracts the sampled voltage and feeds it back to the lowvoltage multistage gain enhancement module The invention has the advantages of small area and high chip integration Compared with the traditional LDO power supply this structure has a higher power supply rejection ratio has stronger antiinterference ability to the external power supply and provides a highvoltageresistant power supply
