The invention relates to a charging and discharging device for battery cells and relates to the field of power supplies AC power is converted into stable DC power on a DC bus through an ACDC isolation conversion module The DC bus is connected to a nonisolated bidirectional DCDC converter and a power multilevel adjustable discharge device  The nonisolated bidirectional DCDC converter can convert the DC bus voltage into a widerange controllable DC voltage to charge battery cells of different voltage levels and can also be used for battery cell discharge by converting excess battery energy to the DC bus and then The power multilevel adjustable discharge device discharges and consumes at different power levels The nonisolated bidirectional DCDC converter can increase or decrease the voltage at the second end to the target battery voltage and make the voltage control accuracy of the second end at It is tens of millivolts level and it is compatible with different types of battery cell voltages at the same time adapting to a very wide voltage range instead of using different types of charging and discharging devices making the design simple and compatible
