 CNU The utility model provides a through shaft assembly The utility model belongs to the field of automobile axles a split structure is adopted between an existing bearing and an adjusting ring The adjusting ring is in threaded connection with the axle housing the through shaft oil seal is arranged on the adjusting ring the adjusting ring is lack of radial limiting the failure of oil leakage ofthe through shaft oil seal is avoided meanwhile due to the split design the processing cost is increased according to the through shaft oil seal the through shaft bearing and the adjusting ring are integrated compared with an original split structure the shaft diameter of the through shaft bearing achieves the radial positioning effect on the thread diameter the radial deviation of threadfit is effectively prevented the sealing reliability of the through shaft oil seal is improved and oil leakage failures are reduced and meanwhile the machining cost of the adjusting ring and bearing assembly structure is reduced
