 CNA The invention discloses a system and method for adjusting multilevel power supply voltage of a power amplifier based on transmitter branch gain setting The system comprises a radio frequency transceiver a stepupstepdown DCDC converter a radio frequency predistorter and a power amplifier wherein the radio frequency transceiver sends an analog voltage signal to the stepupstepdown DCDC converter so as to control the stepupstepdown DCDC converter to output a corresponding power supply voltage value to the power amplifier the radio frequency transceiver sends a radio frequency excitation signal to the radio frequency predistorter a processed radio frequency predistortion signal is sent to the input end of the power amplifier by the radio frequency predistorter the power amplifier amplifies a received radio frequency predistortion signal one part of a generated radio frequency amplification signal is sent to an antenna through a duplexer to be transmitted and the other small part of the generated radio frequency amplification signal is fed back to the radio frequency prdistorter through a coupler and also fed back to the input end of the radio frequency transceiver at the same time
