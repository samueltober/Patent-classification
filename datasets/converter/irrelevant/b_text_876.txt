 USB The modular networking system supplies data and aircraft power to an inflight entertainment communication or cabin management device within the aircraft At least one universal module package for placement within the passenger cabin carries an Ethernet switch which has a processor programmed to support deterministic networking such as according to AVBTNS protocols Devices within the cabin are attachable to ports on the Ethernet switch A power converter circuit and power injector circuit within the module package supply power to devices attached ports on the Ethernet switch A microcontrollercontrolled circuit switch selectively admits or inhibits supply of power attached devices in response to the received control data from the avionics system
