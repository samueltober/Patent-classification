 JPB To prevent a cascade failure in a pump source composed of a plurality of laser diodesSOLUTION A highpower laser system  includes a plurality of cascaded diode drivers a b a pump source  and a laser element  The diode drivers are configured to generate a continuous driver signal The pump source is configured to generate radiated energy in response to the continuous driver signal The laser element is disposed downstream from the pump source and is configured to generate a laser beam in response to stimulation via the radiated energy The highpower laser system further includes an electronic controller  configured to output at least one driver signal that operates the plurality of diode drivers at a fixed frequency The at least one driver signal operates a first diode driver  degrees out of phase with respect to a second diode driverSELECTED DRAWING Figure
