 CNB The invention discloses a steering suspension oil cylinder which integrates a steering oil cylinder a steering center locking oil cylinder and a suspension oil cylinder Oil is injected into a firststeering cavity or a second steering cavity to drive a rack to move rightward or leftward a gear is driven by a gear and rack mechanism to rotate the gear is fixed to a third cylinder bottom and drives a transmission piece connected with the third cylinder bottom to rotate and a connecting base is driven by a spline structure to rotate and is connected with a steering joint so a vehicle steering function is realized oil is injected into a first steering center locking cavity and a second steering center locking cavity at the same time and a third piston and a fourth piston are pushed tomove and pushed to a locking base by using a nut and the locking base in cooperation and fixing the rack to a locked position the center locking function in the vehicle driving process is realizedoil is injected into a first suspension acting cavity or a second suspension acting cavity the connecting base is pushed to move rightward and leftward and the lifting and damping effect on the suspension oil cylinder is realized
