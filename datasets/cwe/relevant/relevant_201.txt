 CNB     The object of the present invention is to prevent the occurrence of jet drool in the injection molding of a protective cover having a thin partition wall on the disk portion The protective cover  is formed by injection molding of synthetic resin and includes a disc part  a sensor holder part  protruding inward from the disc part  and a disc part   A protruding part  protruding inward and connected to the sensor bracket part  The disk part  is formed with a magnetic encoder and a partition wall that separates the magnetic sensors which is thinner than the other parts On the inner surface of the protruding part  there is formed by the abovementioned injection molding The gate mark GM of is provided with a hollow portion  extending inward so as to approach the gate mark GM on the outer surface of the protrusion  In the abovementioned injection molding the molten material of synthetic resin injected from the gate at the gate mark GM changes its direction when it hits the column part for providing the hollow part  and the molten material follows the mold The wall surface flows so no jet drool occurs
