 CNA     The invention discloses a design method and a system for an adaptive fixedperiod sampling controller of a fullvehicle active suspension The specific steps are establishing a fullvehicle active suspension model determining learning parameters and gain constants and combining the wholevehicle active suspension The model learning parameters and gain constant determine the continuoustime sampling control signal and transform it into a stepped sampling control signal through the zeroorder holder The present invention only needs to collect the sampling information of the active vehicle suspension system to achieve the The adaptive control of the active vehicle suspension system not only effectively improves the utilization rate of the vehiclewide active suspension system information in the adaptive control method but also effectively reduces the loss of transmission resources under the network control algorithm and reduces the computational burden of the computer
