 CNB The invention discloses a vehicle balance suspension assembly structure A vehicle frame is used as a carrying body of a suspension system the two ends of a steel plate spring are fixed on the upperend of a vehicle axle through a bridge passing end assembly a balance shaft upmounted structure is used the steel plate spring is arranged at the lower end of a balance shaft case under the condition that the height distance between the vehicle axle and the vehicle frame the dimension and the weight of the balance shaft support seat can reach the optimum state the whole equipment weight is reduced meanwhile during the load bearing the weight is transmitted to the balancing shaft case by the vehicle frame and is then transmitted to the steel plate spring and the vehicle axle the fixed connection stress condition between the balance shaft case and the steel plate spring is reduced the influence by the load bearing weight is avoided the reliability is greatly improved the service life is prolonged The device uses the shaft end assembly of the balance shaft to rotationally connect the steel plate spring and the vehicle frame the self adaptation capability of the conventional balance suspension to the uneven pavement is realized the relative rotation height between the two vehicle axles is increased the vehicle balance suspension assembly structure can adapt to complicated offroads the structure is simple the weight is light the universalization degree is high
