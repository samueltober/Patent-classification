 KRB     The present invention relates to a method for controlling an active suspension device  of a vehicle the active suspension device  comprising at least one spring and at least one damper as actuators   each The actuators   are assigned electromechanical actuating members   acting together with the actuators   in which case each of the electromechanical actuating members   is turned on Connected to at least one electrical energy storage device  of the vehicle via a board electrical system  said at least one electromechanical actuating member   acting as a generator and at least one electricity during driving operation Electrical energy is generated by the mechanical actuating members   and the amount of the electrical energy has a negative value or the at least one electromechanical actuating member   is operated as a motor and the at least one Electric energy is consumed by the electromechanical actuating members   The amount of electrical energy has a positive value in this case from the current value for the amount of electrical energy stored in at least one electrical energy storage device  the electrical energy introduced by the suspension device  during the current operational operation to be performed The value for quantity is subtracted where the value for the detected difference in electrical energy is compared to at least one threshold the difference in electrical energy is greater than the maximum threshold and at least one first electromechanical actuating member  When  is operated as a generator at least one second electromechanical actuating member   is operated as a motor and electrical energy generated by at least one first electromechanical actuating member   At least a portion of the is simultaneously converted into mechanical energy by at least one second electromechanical actuating member
