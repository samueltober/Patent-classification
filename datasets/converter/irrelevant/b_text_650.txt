 CNA The invention provides a cascaded Hbridge converter control method under a power grid harmonic background and provides an improved unit vector directional direct current control strategy under a natural coordinate system by taking improvement of the control performance of a converter under the power grid harmonic background as a target and taking a singlephase cascaded Hbridge converter as anobject so as to enable the output current power factor to be controllable and the total harmonic distortion rate of the current to meet the requirements of a power grid According to the control method the fundamental frequency component of the power grid is rapidly extracted by using a delay signal cancellation method and an ideal unit vector under a natural coordinate is solved for orientation so that an accurate current reference value is obtained and direct current control is carried out by using a proportional resonance controller with excellent performance and the influence of theharmonic background on the control system is further eliminated through distortion voltage proportion feedforward
