 CNU The utility model discloses an AGV structure with a damping and lifting mechanism Main parts of the damping structure comprise a wheel connecting frame a bearing supporting piece and a spring damper And the wheel connecting frame is connected with the vehicle body through the spring shock absorber The lifting mechanism is mainly composed of a jacking support a hydraulic cylinder a top plateand a bottom end rail The bottom end rail is fixed with the vehicle body the top rail is fixed with the top plate the jacking supports on the two sides act at the same time through a connecting rod One end of the jacking bracket is fixed with the rail and the other end moves along with the connecting rod and the hydraulic cylinder pushes the connecting rod to enable the lifting device to belifted or lowered The AGV is simple in structure all parts work in a coordinated mode the damping and lifting functions of the AGV are mainly achieved and the AGV has high practicability and wideapplicability
