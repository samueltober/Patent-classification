 CNU A first positioning groove is formed in an inner cavity of an outer ring body a Cshaped sealing ring is connected to the inner surface of the first positioning groove in a sliding mode a second positioning groove is formed in the outer surface of the inner ring body and the inner surface of the second positioning groove is connected with the outer surface of the Cshaped sealing ring in a sliding mode A supporting ball is connected to an inner cavity of the Cshaped sealing ring in a pressing mode According to the hub unit with the cap and the rubber sealing structure the first positioning groove and the second positioning groove are cooperated to guarantee the stability of the position of the Cshaped sealing ring the two Cshaped sealing rings and the positioning frame are cooperated to limit the position of the supporting ball the supporting ball intermittently supports the Cshaped sealing ring from the interior of the Cshaped sealing ring and damage to the Cshaped sealing ring is reduced the sealing effect is improved the side sealing rings are used for sealing from the right side the sealing effect is further improved and the problem that a common hub inner sealing device is poor in sealing effect is solved
