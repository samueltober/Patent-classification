The invention provides a bidirectional DCDC converter and a slow start control method and the method comprises the steps firstly only closing a slow start relay at a first side of the bidirectionalDCDC converter and closing all relays on a bus at the first side after the charging of positive and negative halfbus capacitors corresponding to the slow start relay is finished then charging thepositive and negative halfbus capacitors on the second side of the bidirectional DCDC converter by controlling the action of a conversion branch on the first side of the bidirectional DCDC converteruntil the voltage of the positive and negative halfbus capacitors on the second side of the bidirectional DCDC converter is equal to a preset voltage and finally controlling all relays on the bus on the second side of the bidirectional DCDC converter to be closed so that the bidirectional DCDC converter can reliably enter a normal operation state and the problem of halfbus capacitor bias ina slow start process caused by low external insulation impedance in the prior art is avoided
