The invention discloses a method and system for optimal planning of AC and DC receiving end power grids containing mutual exclusion constraints belonging to the field of power system planning The method includes determining a line set to be selected the line set to be selected includes lines with mutually exclusive constraints Mutually exclusive constraint variable set and mutually exclusive constraint variable range set are used to describe the construction type and state of construction of lines with mutually exclusive constraints the construction type is any of conventional DC lines flexible straight lines and AC lines The construction status is under construction or not under construction for different types of investment and construction the corresponding constraint conditions are determined so as to establish an ACDC receivingend power grid optimization planning model with the goal of minimizing the construction cost solve the planning model to obtain the ACDC receivingend power grid Optimal planning scheme Compared with the existing method the present invention formalizes the CSP description of the mutual exclusion phenomenon in the concentration of the lines to be selected integrates the mutually exclusive lines to be built into the optimization planning model and participates in the optimization planning process thereby ensuring that an optimized planning scheme can be obtained
