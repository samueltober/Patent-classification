To reduce power consumption of an ANC systemSOLUTION An ANC system  includes an AD converter  which ADconverts an external noise signal an ANC digital processing unit  which generates a signal for canceling a noise component which reaches the users ear based on the output signal of the AD converter  and a level detector A which powers down the ANC digital processing unit  when an output signal value is equal to or less than the threshold value and recovers the ANC digital processing unit  from the powered down operation when the output signal value exceeds the threshold valueSELECTED DRAWING Figure
