 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of AGVs in particular to a damping structure of a differential AGV driving wheel system A damping structure of a differential AGV driving wheel system comprises a rack driving system assemblies driving wheels and a support and is characterized in that the driving system assemblies are arranged on the left side and the right side of the rack respectively the driving ends of the driving system assemblies are connected with the driving wheels through shafts and the driving wheels are connected with the damping structure through the support Compared with the prior art the shock absorption mechanism can effectively relieve impact when the ground is uneven or a trolley rack is subjected to profit impact the driving shaft can be effectively protected against stress impact and the driving shaft is prevented from being broken due to impact
