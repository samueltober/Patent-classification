 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device for a wheel which can eliminate an anxiety that the sealing performance of a seal member is lowered and can improve a bearing life by preventing the damage of a rolling body or the like and in which a cutoff weir being a constituent member of the bearing device does not become an obstacle at the exchange of a hub boltSOLUTION In a bearing device  for a wheel a disc circular cutoff weir  with a rotating axis L of an inner member  as a center is arranged at an external periphery of an outerside end part of an outer member  the cutoff weir  is formed into an asymmetric shape at an upper half side Us and a lower half side Ls of the outer member  and a weir wall face a in one portion or an entire portion of the upper half side Us is inclined to an inner side as progressing toward the outside of a radial directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
