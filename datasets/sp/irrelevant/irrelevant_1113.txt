 CNU The utility model provides a transverse composite material plate spring suspension structure Vehicle frame an axle is mounted below the frame connecting mechanisms are installed on the two sides ofthe frame axle connecting plates are connected to the bottom ends of the connecting mechanisms first supporting plates are installed at the bottom ends of the axle connecting plates Ushaped fixing pieces are installed at the top ends of the first supporting plates first fixing nuts are installed at the tail ends of the Ushaped fixing pieces and second supporting plates are connected to thetail ends of the axle connecting plates The utility model provides a transverse composite material plate spring suspension structure The transverse composite material plate spring suspension structure is provided with a fixing mechanism compared with a traditional plate spring suspension structure the plate spring suspension structure has the advantages that the structure is simple comparedwith the prior art the connection performance is more stable the stability between the vehicle frame and the plate spring suspension is higher when the vehicle body moves the plate spring suspension can better play the due role of the plate spring suspension safety accidents caused by infirm fixation are avoided and the personal safety of passengers is protected
