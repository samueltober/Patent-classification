 CNB The invention discloses a microgrid system of considering operating characteristics of microsources and a power frequency division control method for the microgrid system According to the system load demand power is divided into an ultralow frequency band a lowfrequency band and a mediumhigh frequency band wherein a storage battery pack works on the lowfrequency band and the stability of DC bus voltage is maintained by adopting a voltage control mode a diesel generator set and a new energy power generation system work on the ultralow frequency band and ultralow frequency power required by load is output by adopting a current control mode and a supercapacitor works on the mediumhigh frequency band to stabilize highfrequency power fluctuation of the load The invention providesan algorithm for decomposing the power required by the load according to the bands and a secondary distribution method of the ultralow frequency power By adopting the system and the control methoddisclosed by the invention power balance of a source end and a load end of a microgrid can be achieved the harm of the highfrequency power fluctuation to sensitive microsources such as storage batteries can also be effectively reduced the service life of equipment is prolonged and the operation efficiency of the system can be significantly improved
