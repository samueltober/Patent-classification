 CNA The invention discloses a current stress optimization control method for a dualactive bridge converter based on extended phaseshift control and the method comprises the following steps  dividing the expansion phase shift control into two modes and calculating a per unit transmission power and a voltage conversion ratio through the input voltage and the output voltage of a sampling converter  according to the perunit transmission power and the voltage conversion ratio obtaining an optimal phase shifting combination enabling the current stress to be minimum in a global range specifically according to the perunit transmission power and the boundary constraint condition obtaining a feasible region deriving the perunit current stress in the feasible region to obtain the minimum current stress in each mode comparing the two modes to obtain the minimum current stress in the global range and  generating a driving pulse of a switch tube through PWM Pulse Width Modulation pulse width modulation by the optimal phase shift ratio combination and completing the control process Compared with traditional singlephaseshift control the current stress can be obviously reduced the loss is reduced and the efficiency of the converter is improved
