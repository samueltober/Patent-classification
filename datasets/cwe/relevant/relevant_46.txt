 CNB A bearing device for a wheel formed by fitting a rolling bearing to the inner periphery of a hub ring and positioning and securing the rolling bearing by a retaining ring wherein the bearing device has improved durability obtained by preventing small cracks from occurring even if the bearing device is subjected to a large moment load during operation A bearing device for a wheel is formed by fitting a rolling bearing  to the inner periphery of a hub ring  and positioning and securing the rolling bearing  by a retaining ring  The retaining ring  is mounted further toward the inner side than the center line BC of the bearing A retainingring groove  for mounting the retaining ring  is formed near a staking section  in a substantially rectangular crosssectional shape Both the corners   of the retainingring groove  are formed to have circular arc surfaces having different curvature radiuses and the curvature radius of the corner  of the corners which is on the outer side is set to be greater than the curvature radius of the corner  on the inner side
