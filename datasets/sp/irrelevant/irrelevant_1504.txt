 CNA The invention relates to an active suspension control method based on depth determinacy strategy gradient and belongs to the technical field of automobile dynamic control and artificial intelligenceThe implementation of active suspension control is divided into three stages firstly a simulation training process is carried out a suspension control strategy is expressed by a neural network and parameters of the control strategy are updated by adopting a depth deterministic strategy gradient algorithm secondly a trained strategy is downloaded and after training convergence parameters and the structure of the neural network are stored as a trained control strategy and finally the trained strategy can be directly applied on line and active suspension vibration reduction control isachieved The active suspension control method based on the depth determinacy strategy gradient is adopted the neural network is fully trained on a large number of random road surfaces the obtainedsuspension control strategy has great generalization performance an active suspension system can effectively play a role in vibration reduction under the condition of variable road surfaces and therefore riding comfort is guaranteed and meanwhile the overall safety of a vehicle is guaranteed
