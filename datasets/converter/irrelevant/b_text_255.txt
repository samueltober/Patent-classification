 JPB To provide a power conversion device capable of stably supplying power to a load regardless of variations in a voltage value of a supplied DC voltageSOLUTION A power conversion device  includes a power converter  including a first unit converter a and a second unit converter b connected in cascade and a controller  that generates a first gate drive signal having a first phase for output voltage and a second gate drive signal having a second phase for the output voltage to perform onepulse control of the power converter The first phase and the second phase are set to phases having different values and the control device replaces the phases having different values with each other at a predetermined cycle The control device sets a phase having a value for compensation based on respective voltage values of a first DC voltage supplied to the first unit converter and a second DC voltage supplied to the second unit converter and replaces all phases sequentiallySELECTED DRAWING Figure
