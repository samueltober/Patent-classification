The invention discloses a method for determining the flexibility and straightness transformation time sequence of a multiinfeed receivingend power grid and the method comprises the steps building a linear weighting model on the basis of the calculation of a DC side evaluation index value an AC side evaluation index value and an economic evaluation index value after conventional DC flexibility and straightness transformation and obtaining a weight coefficient of each evaluation index by adopting a comprehensive weighting method so as to calculate a comprehensive score value of each conventional directcurrent flexible directcurrent transformation and carrying out flexible directcurrent transformation of the conventional direct current according to a sequence of comprehensive scores from high to low The method is clear in logic convenient to operate and high in practicability and has important guiding significance for flexible directcurrent transformation of conventional directcurrent engineering
