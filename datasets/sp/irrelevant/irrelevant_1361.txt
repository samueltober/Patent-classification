 CNU The utility model discloses a composite diecasting aluminum lightweight hub in an independent air suspension system which comprises a hub body the inner wall of the hub body is provided with a hubbearing limiting surface and a hub bearing mounting surface the hub bearing limiting surface and the hub bearing mounting surface are arranged in a stepped hole shape and the hub bearing limiting surface and the hub bearing mounting surface are arranged in a stepped hole shape And stainless steel second metal sleeves are arranged in the hub bearing mounting surface and the hub bearing limitingsurface The lightweight hub is formed by diecasting aluminum compared with an existing ductile iron casting part the overall mass is obviously reduced the middle of the lightweight hub and a hubbearing installation part are formed by diecasting stainless steel bushings and the problem that the thermal expansion coefficient of an aluminum alloy material is high can be effectively avoided And the problems of casting deformation and rusting corrosion in the later use process of the traditional ductile iron piece are also avoided
