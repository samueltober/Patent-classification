 CNA The invention provides a hierarchical coordination voltage control method and system for a hybrid multiinfeed ACDC hybrid system The method comprises the following steps  calculating the track sensitivity of each bus voltage and the voltage sensitivity of each control quantity to a directcurrent feedin bus  judging whether systemlevel control and converter stationlevel control are started or not  calculating the reactive power margin of the generator based on the widearea measurement data and determining whether the systemlevel participation coordination control quantity comprises a converter stationlevel control quantity or not  optimizing and solving a corresponding optimal control sequence of voltage stability coordination control  judging whether the control quantities in the twostage optimal control sequences of the system and the converter station conflict or not if yes selecting the control quantities according to a coordination control rule for application detecting whether the load bus voltage meets a preset requirement or not after application and if yes exiting coordination control otherwise repeating the steps  until the voltage of the load bus meets the preset requirement And the mediumandlongterm voltage stability of the system can be improved
