 CNA The invention provides a hybrid converter topology suitable for offshore wind power delivery and a control strategy thereof Largescale fans are gathered to an offshore alternatingcurrent bus through a converter sent out through rectification of an offshore converter inverted through a directcurrent cable to an onshore converter and then connected into an alternatingcurrent power grid The offshore converter adopted by the invention comprises an active commutation type current source converter CSC and a voltage source converter VSC wherein the CSC and the VSC are cascaded The offshore VSC adopts constant alternatingcurrent voltagefrequency control and power return and power output are realized in the black start and power output stages of the wind power plant The hybrid converter topology and the control strategy thereof provided by the invention have the advantages that the hybrid offshore wind power sendingout converter topology not only can realize wind power black start but further is convenient for establishing alternating current bus voltage and compared with a pure VSC offshore sendingend converter the hybrid offshore wind power sendingout converter topology further reduces the size and the weight of an offshore platform
