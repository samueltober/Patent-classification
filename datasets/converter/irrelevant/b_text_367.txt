 CNB The invention provides a wind field multiterminal flexible DC control method capable of actively supporting the frequency of a power grid and also provides a system for executing the method The method and the system comprise the control of a receivingend converter station and the control of a sendingend converter station Phaselockedloopfree autonomous power grid synchronous control is realized at the receivingend converter station by utilizing inherent dynamic characteristics of a DC bus equivalent capacitor so that the receivingend converter station reflects an AC power grid as avoltage source and the problem of resonance of connection into a weak power grid is solved A virtual resistor is added to the DC side so that the DC side has a droop characteristic to coordinate power distribution among multiple receivingend converter stations In addition the DC side voltage of the receivingend converter station can automatically respond to the frequency changes of the power grid On one hand DC system power flow can be automatically adjusted and power can be called from other power grids to achieve a primary frequency modulation function On the other hand the DC bus voltage can be linked with the frequency deviation of the power grid and the frequency change information of the power grid can be transmitted to a wind field side through the sendingend converterstation to assist the wind field in realizing inertia response
