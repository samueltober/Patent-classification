 USA Provided is a control method for a parallel MMC unit of a LCCMMC hybrid cascade converter station The control strategy includes  numbering all MMC units connected in parallel in a MMC valve manifold  for a MMC unit using a constant directcurrent voltage control manner calculating a directcurrent instruction value of the MMC unit according to a directcurrent measurement value  for a MMC unit using a constant active power control manner calculating an active power instruction value of the MMC unit according to the rated capacity of the MMC unit and a directcurrent instruction value of a system rectifier station  for the MMC unit using the constant directcurrent voltage control manner correcting a directcurrent voltage instruction value of the MMC unit by using the directcurrent instruction value and the directcurrent measurement value and controlling the MMC unit according to the corrected directcurrent voltage instruction value
