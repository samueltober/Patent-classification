 CNU     The utility model discloses a shockabsorbing device applied to agricultural machinery belonging to the field of agricultural machinery The scheme lifts the basket to remove the pressure of the basket on the shockabsorbing support column The pressure of the module is reduced the spring elastically recovers and the two are driven The first piston rod resets upwards and a first piston cylinder resets downwards Open the shockabsorbing support column buckle the two pullup openings on the pressure plate of the damaged module to pull out the damaged module replace it with a new module Put the shockabsorbing support column back into the first groove lower the car basket the two shockabsorbing support columns press down the pressure plate under force and the pressure plate presses down the first limit plate under the force so that the two first piston rods are pressed down And a first piston cylinder is lifted up at the same time two piston heads make a downward movement one piston head makes an upward movement the kinetic energy and the air pressure are offset in the sealed piston groove and the spring is reset synchronously to offset part of the force upwards and finally realize the The modular installation and disassembly of the device is convenient for maintenance and handling in emergency situations and the operation is simple and quick
