 USB A mediumhigh voltage photovoltaic PV power generation system is provided A PV string of the system is insulated from the ground via an insulator of a mediumhigh voltage withstanding level so that the PV string is applicable under a high voltage level The PV strings are connected to cascade modules An output voltage of seriesconnected cascade modules is gridconnected to a  kV power grid through a threephase filter without a power booster transformer or a highfrequency isolated DCDC converter in a conventional power station thereby improving the system efficiency
