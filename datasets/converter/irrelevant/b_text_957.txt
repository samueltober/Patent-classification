 CNA     A singlestage bidirectional ACDC converter with variable structure and wide output range is composed of mphase AC filter m mphase cycloconverter and n primary sides in series A highfrequency transformer n highfrequency bidirectional fullbridge rectifiers with output filter capacitors and structure selection modules are sequentially cascaded Among them the secondary side of each transformer is connected to a highfrequency bidirectional fullbridge rectifier and n fullbridge rectifiers The output terminal is connected to the structure selection module Using a dualloop control strategy with ACside power factor correction and DCside current control the converter can achieve bidirectional power flow The converter is a singlestage power conversion without a DC link which solves the problems of short life of the DC bus electrolytic capacitor and improves the reliability of the converter the converter changes the series of each highfrequency bidirectional fullbridge rectifier through the structure selection module  Parallel structure can effectively reduce the stress of the device to achieve a wide range of largecapacity output
