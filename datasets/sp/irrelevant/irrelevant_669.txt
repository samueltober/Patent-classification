 CNA The invention discloses an automobile suspension hybrid damping extensible switching control method The method comprises the following steps that  a vehicle body vertical acceleration signal of a vehicle is obtained according to a vehicle body vertical acceleration sensor  a tire dynamic load signal Fd is estimated and obtained according to a preposition presight sensor and a Kalman observer  different control ranges are divided by using an upper extensible switching controller the system stability of the switching control is considered a corresponding correlation function is designed the vehicle body acceleration and the tire dynamic load signal are taken as inputs and the assigned weight alpha of the control switching logic and hybrid damping of a lower controller is obtained  a suspension dynamic travel stroke fd is obtained based on a signal detected by a suspension dynamic travel sensor and  the vehicle body acceleration the tire vibration and the suspension dynamic load which are obtained in the step  the step  and the step  respectively as well as the assigned weight alpha and the switching logic obtained through the upper extensible controller in the step  are taken as inputs and the optimal damping coefficient satisfying the control requirement is obtained through the lower hybrid damping controller
