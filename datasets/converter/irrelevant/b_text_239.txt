 USB An aircraft power system includes a frontend power converter and a backend power converter The frontend power converter is configured to generate a first direct current DC supply voltage or a second DC supply voltage based on a voltage level of an alternating current AC supply voltage output from an AC voltage source The backend power converter subsystem is configured to convert the first DC supply voltage or the second DC supply voltage into a backend supply voltage An active power distribution system is configured to select different electrical paths between the frontend converter and the backend converter subsystem in response to detecting output of the first DC supply voltage and the second DC supply voltage
