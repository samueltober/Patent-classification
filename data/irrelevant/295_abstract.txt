The invention discloses a method for improving the dynamic performance of a synchronous rectification primaryside feedback flyback power supply aiming at the shortcomings of the existing dynamic control algorithm under lowpower DCM especially the dynamic recovery time under the condition of heavy load and light load The defect of too long by controlling the switch of the primary side switch tube of the converter and the synchronous rectifier tube of the secondary side to switch with a fixed duty cycle the energy of the load capacitance at the output end is extracted to the primary side so that the output voltage drops rapidly and at the same time the The output voltage is sampled at the frequency of and when the output voltage drops to the rated value the steadystate mode corresponding to the system after jumping out of the high dynamic mode is determined according to the load size and then the system enters the steadystate mode The invention can shorten the output voltage within ms and the output voltage ripple is small when the system leaves the dynamic mode and enters the steadystate mode which significantly improves the dynamic performance of the flyback converter under high power
