 CNU The combined type rubber auxiliary spring front suspension system of the heavyduty car comprises a largerigidity limiting block a rubber auxiliary spring an auxiliary spring support and a ventilation hollow bolt the auxiliary spring support is connected with a frame ventral surface and a wing surface and the connection reliability of the auxiliary spring support is improved the contact surface of the rubber auxiliary spring and the auxiliary spring bracket is far larger than the free outer diameter of the rubber auxiliary spring so that the sudden change of the rigidity of the auxiliary spring in the bearing process is avoided the rubber auxiliary spring is connected with the auxiliary spring bracket through the ventilation hollow bolt so that the rubber auxiliary spring cannot generate an air expansion phenomenon during bearing the rubber auxiliary spring is arranged behind the center of the front axle and can limit the longitudinal torsion of the steel plate spring when avehicle brakes the highrigidity limiting block is arranged right above the front shaft and can be used for limiting in time under the impact load on the premise that the rigidity of the steel platespring is reduced the bearing capacity of a suspension system is guaranteed the service life of the plate spring is prolonged the rubber auxiliary spring is protected through the largerigidity limiting block the reliability of the whole system is improved and the suspension system has the advantages of being high in comfort and high in reliability
