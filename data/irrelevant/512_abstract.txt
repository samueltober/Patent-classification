The invention discloses a multimicrogrid system power failure fault recovery method system and device and the method comprises the steps building a multimicrogrid system model under a power failure fault and judging whether there is a microgrid alliance meeting a cooperative game condition in the multimicrogrid system model or not selecting a microgrid alliance with enough driving force for active cooperation from the microgrid so the stability of the microgrid alliance is improved establishing the multimicrogrid cooperative game model so the microgrid alliance supplies power to the load in a cooperative form employing the Shapley value to allocate the extra income of power supply and judging the stability of the microgrid alliance according to the allocation of the income if the income is not stable allocating the income again so the stability of the microgrid alliance is ensured According to the embodiment of the invention the condition of the cooperative game condition of each microgrid in the power failure recovery period and the distribution mechanism of earnings generated after cooperation are considered the cooperation among the microgrids is promoted and the operation safety and reliability of the multimicrogrid system are improved
