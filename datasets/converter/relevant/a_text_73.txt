 CNA     A DCDC converter and its control strategy combining the advantages and disadvantages of the MMC and ISOPDAB structures adopts a structure based on MMC and cascaded Hbridges for medium and low voltage DC distribution networks The medium voltage side of the structure bears the voltage of the medium voltage level through the MMC which improves the reliability of the equipment The lowvoltage side is connected in series with the AC side through multiple cascaded Hbridges to adapt to the lowvoltage bus voltage and larger current The modular combination scheme can effectively increase the power capacity reduce the stress of the power tube and enhance the redundancy of the system the interleaved phase shift control strategy is adopted between the modulation signals of each module to reduce the system current ripple and filter components Design parameters The basic control scheme of the medium voltage side of the present invention adopts equal CPSPWM control and unequal CPSPWM control which can effectively improve the transmission characteristics of the DC converter
