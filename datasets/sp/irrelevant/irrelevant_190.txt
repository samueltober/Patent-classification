 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide an insulator that can reduce the weightSOLUTION An insulator is interposed between an outside member of a strut mount where a rubber elastic body binds together with an inside member and the outside member and a bearing A cylindershaped cylindrical part of the insulator covers over the outside member and a discshaped flange part protrudes on an outside in a radial direction from a first end part of the cylindrical part The flange part and the cylindrical part are integrally molded with the rubber elastic body thereby reducing a volume of the insulator Thus the insulator can be reduced in the weight thereofSELECTED DRAWING Figure
