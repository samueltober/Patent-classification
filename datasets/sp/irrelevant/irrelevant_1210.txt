 CNU A suspension swing arm can elastically connect a vehicle body with a vehicle to relieve impact caused by ground pits in the running process of the vehicle and improve riding comfort and comprises a swing arm body a lower cover plate and a damping spring and the front side and the rear side of the swing arm body are bent downwards for the first time to form a first edge reinforcing wall the suspension swing arm provided by the utility model comprises the first edge reinforcing wall and the second edge reinforcing wall which can enhance the bending resistance and the tensile strength of the swing arm and have good load impact bearing capacity so that the swing arm is not easy to break when bumping for a long time or being impacted by a load the contact bottom of the spiral downward spring is matched with the damping spring so that the damping spring can be in a better compression state during compression and the situations of spring deviation and elastic force acting direction deviation are avoided the electrophoresis layer on the surface of the swing arm body can improve the load impact bearing capacity of the swing arm
