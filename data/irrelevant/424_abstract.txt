The invention discloses a switching power supply and a control method thereof so as to widen the output voltage range of the switching power supply The switching power supply comprises a multioutputDCDC conversion circuit a voltage switching circuit and a Boost circuit which are cascaded between an input port and an output port of the switching power supply The multioutput DCDC conversioncircuit is used for converting one path of switching power supply input voltage into multiple paths of output voltages with different magnitudes the voltage switching circuit is used for selecting one path of output voltage of the multioutput DCDC conversion circuit for outputting the output voltage range of the switching power supply is divided into a plurality of levels in advance and the higher the level of the switching power supply voltage needing to be output at the current moment is the higher the voltage selected to be output by the voltage switching circuit is the Boost circuitis used for carrying out boost conversion on the output voltage of the voltage switching circuit to obtain switching power supply voltage needing to be output at the current moment
