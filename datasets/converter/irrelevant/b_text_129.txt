 CNB The invention provides a Markov modelbased multienergy complementary system random stability analysis method In order to reasonably describe the changing condition of the illumination and the windspeed existing illumination data wind speed data and the like are subjected to clustering analysis and then the center point of each cluster is obtained The center point of each cluster is adoptedas one Markov state A transfer rate matrix between all states is obtained through Bayesian reasoning According to the Kirchhoff voltage and current law a Markov state space model is built On theabove basis a random Lyapunov function is constructed for carrying out the random stability analysis Moreover though detecting the current value of a grid connection point a current controller isdesigned to carry out the insitu reduction of an adjustable load According to the fluctuation condition of the new energy power generation the consumption amount of the load is adjusted Thereforethe power transmitted to the power grid is guaranteed to be continuous and stable Finally the simulation operator test is established and then the effectiveness and the practicability of the methodare verified
