 CNB The invention provides a cascade multilevel converter and an implementation method thereof The cascade multilevel converter device comprises a doublecapacitor basic module a doublecapacitor submodule and an Hbridge unit According to the converter highlevel and highgain output effects of the converter are realized through stepped charging and series superposition of double capacitors in the modules and seriesparallel conversion between the modules the Hbridge unit completes bipolar level conversion of the converter the converter can further increase the number of output levels andimprove the output voltage gain through the expansion of the doublecapacitor submodule unit The converter disclosed by the invention has the advantages that the capacitor has a voltage selfbalancing capability so that an extra capacitor voltage control loop is avoided a doublecapacitor cooperative work mode is adopted in the module unit the number of used power devices of the converter device is effectively reduced and the manufacturing cost of the converter is reduced
