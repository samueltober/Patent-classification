The invention belongs to the field of power markets and the field of hydropower dispatching operation and particularly relates to a highproportion hydropower system dayahead spot clearing method based on cascade electric quantity linkage control The method aims at highproportion hydroelectric market characteristics The method comprises constructing an MILP model with the minimum electricitypurchasing cost as the target bringing cascade hydropower station daily electric quantity dynamic control into system constraints establishing an upstream and downstream cascade linkage control boundary based on the iterative transaction electric quantity automatically loading the target and the constraints to a commercial solver optimization framework and achieving efficient model solving through model iterative optimization According to the method the clearing plan meeting the cascade hydraulic constraint condition can be quickly given the requirements for timeliness and practicability of dayahead market clearing of the highproportion hydropower system are met and a feasible thought is provided for dayahead spot clearing of the highproportion hydropower market
