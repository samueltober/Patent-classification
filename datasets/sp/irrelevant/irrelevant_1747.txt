 CNU The utility model discloses a front suspension framework which comprises a supporting main beam and a pin seat a front suspension is installed at one end of the supporting main beam a supporting frame is installed on one side of the front suspension a main pin is installed in the supporting frame a damping spring is installed on the outer surface of the main pin a connecting block is installed at one end of the damping spring and a connecting rod is installed at the other end of the connecting block A second direction joint connector is installed in the second direction joint connector base a threaded hole is formed in one side of the second direction joint connector one end of the second direction joint connector is connected with a transverse pull rod and a fixing base is installed at one end of the transverse pull rod Due to the fact that the damping spring is arranged when an automobile runs on a bumpy road section the vertical swing amplitude of the connecting block is large the damping spring stretches out and draws back through the elasticity of the damping spring impact force caused by vertical swing of the connecting block is counteracted and therefore the situation that the swing amplitude in the automobile is large is avoided and the riding comfort of the automobile is improved
