 CNA A strut bearing  comprising a cover  a guide ring  and a bearing device provided between the cover  and the guide ring  An antisputtering plate  extending along a radial direction of the strut bearing  and a circumferential direction thereof is comprised at the periphery of the guide ring  A first gap G is formed between the periphery of the cover  and the antisputtering plate  The antisputtering plate  comprises at least one raised line    protruded from an upper surface of the antisputtering plate  The raisedline    extends continuously or discontinuously in the circumferential direction is used for decreasing the size of the first gap G and has the similar effect of a breakwater so asto reduce the possibility that foreign bodies such as water mud and particles are introduced into the interior of the strut bearing  thereby avoiding the increase of friction of the strut bearing  and the early failure thereof
