The invention is applicable to the technical field of electric power and provides a control method of a multilevel converter which comprises the following steps of acquiring the inductive currentof an LC filter in a driving pulse period determining a tobeadjusted first switching tube and a duty ratio adjustment amount of the tobeadjusted first switching tube based on the slope of the rising period of the inductive current and adjusting the duty ratio of the tobeadjusted first switching tube based on the duty ratio adjustment amount of the tobeadjusted first switching tube and determining a tobeadjusted second switching tube and a duty ratio adjustment amount of the tobeadjusted second switching tube based on the slope of the falling period of the inductive current andadjusting the duty ratio of the tobeadjusted second switching tube based on the duty ratio adjustment amount of the tobeadjusted second switching tube According to the invention the voltage of each flying capacitor of the multilevel converter can be controlled to be balanced only by acquiring the inductive current of the LC filter and the implementation method is simple and is not influenced by the level number of the multilevel converter
