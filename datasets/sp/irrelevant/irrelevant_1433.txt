 WOA The invention relates to a threepoint link  having two link arms  which enclose an acute angle one end of each of said link arms at the same time meeting in a central joint   wherein the central joint  has a cylindrical dome  that extends in an axial direction a that extends at least substantially perpendicular to a plane spanned by the two link arms   the central joint  has a joint ball  that is penetrated by the dome   the central joint  further has to prevent a complete separate of same a captive securing means  which acts as a stop and extends in a radial direction r perpendicular to the axial direction a  the captive securing means  is also penetrated by the dome  and at the same time is secured by an annular securing element  against being axially pulled out of the dome   the annular securing element  seen in the axial direction a is arranged on a side of the captive securing means  facing away from the joint ball  and at the same time engages in a circumferential groove  of the dome  The invention is characterised in that the annular securing element  is in the radial direction r enclosed by the captive securing means  bearing thereon such that said annular securing element  is prevented from coming out of the circumferential groove  of the dome  because the annular securing element  cannot move out of the circumferential groove  of the dome  in the radial direction r
