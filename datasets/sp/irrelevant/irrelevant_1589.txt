 CNA The invention discloses an independent suspension and vibration reduction integrated differential driving wheel device and a control method thereof The device comprises a differential wheel adapter plate a steering assembly a differential driving wheel assembly and a mechanical limiting assembly The differential wheel adapter plate is connected with differential driving wheel assemblies located on the two sides and each differential driving wheel assembly is composed of a suspension damping assembly and a power assembly The steering assembly comprises a mechanical encoder a slewing bearing and a small gear when the slewing bearing rotates teeth on the outer ring of the slewing bearing are meshed with the small gear the rotating angle is indirectly transmitted to the mechanical encoder connected with the small gear and realtime monitoring of the rotating angle of the differential driving wheel device is achieved According to the device the large transverse span required byan AGV body can be met the operation stability of the AGV is improved meanwhile the suspension vibration reduction assembly adopts an independent design form the problem that when the ground on the two sides of the trolley is not at the same height the suspension assembly is unbalanced in control is solved and the phenomenon of jamming caused by integral suspension vibration reduction adjustment is prevented
