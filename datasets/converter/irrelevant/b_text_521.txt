 WOA A power converter  includes at least one arm   having a plurality of converter cells  connected to each other in cascade The converter cells  each have a pair of inputoutput terminals a plurality of switching elements and an electricity storage element The electricity storage element is electrically connected to the inputoutput terminals through the plurality of switching elements A control device  generates a control signal for controlling the onoff of the plurality of switching elements of each of the converter cells  The control device generates in each of the converter cells  the control signal so as to suppress a harmonic component of a predetermined frequency by a pulse width modulation control based on a modulation command signal that corresponds to a command value of the output voltage between the inputoutput terminals and includes an AC component of a fundamental wave frequency said harmonic component being included in the output voltage and being an integer multiple of the fundamental wave frequency
