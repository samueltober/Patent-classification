 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a wheel bearing device that can reduce deformation of an outerside opening of an outer member while suppressing an increase in the whole weight to the minimum to inhibit deterioration in roundness of a rolling surface coming into contact with a ball train thereby preventing a decline in rolling fatigue lifeSOLUTION The wheel bearing device  includes a plurality of thick wall parts f protruding in a radial direction from an outer peripheral surface of the outer member  whereby a thickness dimension in an outside rolling surface d formed on a side of a wheel fitting flange b is unequal in a circumferential directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
