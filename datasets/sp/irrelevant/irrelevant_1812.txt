 CNA The invention particularly relates to an allterrain vehicle threeconnectingrod rear suspension which is reliable in structure and capable of compensating camber angle changes of wheels caused by aging and abrasion of parts The rear suspension structure comprises an inclined swing arm a shock absorber a stand column an angular contact ball bearing a hub a first transverse swing arm and a second transverse swing arm The inclined swing arm is formed by welding the first diagonal draw bar the second diagonal draw bar and the supporting rod and a triangle is defined so that the rear suspension structure bears better vertical force and longitudinal force and the inclined swing arm is not prone to breakage The length of the first transverse swing arm can be adjusted through threaded connection between a first rod end knuckle bearing and a first welding sleeve or threaded connection between a second rod end knuckle bearing and a second welding sleeve The length of the second transverse swing arm can be adjusted through threaded connection of a third rod end knuckle bearing and a third welding sleeve or threaded connection of a fourth rod end knuckle bearing and a fourth welding sleeve so that the camber angle of the wheel is adjusted and wheel camber angle changes caused by aging and abrasion of parts are compensated
