 JPA To restrict uneven wear of a bush even if an uneven load in a radial direction is applied to a slide bearing structureSOLUTION A slide bearing structure comprises a cylindrical bush holder  fixed to an outer peripheral surface of a shaft portion  of a second member  and a cylindrical bush  supported by the bush holder  so as to be displaceable in a circumferential direction and so as to be displaceable in an axial direction at a predetermined stroke and that is in slidecontact with an inner peripheral surface of an axial hole  of a first member  The bush holder  includes a plurality of holderside projections  provided on a shaft end portion at intervals in the circumferential direction The bush  includes a plurality of bushside projections  corresponding to the holderside projections  and provided on a shaft end portion at intervals in the circumferential direction Either one of the bushside projections  and the holderside projections  has an asymmetric shape so as to convert relative axial displacement between the bush holder  and the bush  into rotational displacement of the bush SELECTED DRAWING Figure
