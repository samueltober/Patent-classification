 JPB To provide a thrust slide bearing in which a dust cover covering a piston rod of a strut type suspension is surely and simply assembled into a lower case overlapped with an upper case and a mold structure is simple as molding the lower caseSOLUTION A thrust slide bearing  is configured such that a lower case  sliding rotatably around an axial core C of an upper case  has a plurality of upper tongue pieces  engaged to a case side projection b of the upper case  and a plurality of lower tongue pieces  engaged to a cover side projection Da of a duct cover D and the upper tongue pieces  and lower tongue pieces  of the lower case  project in an axial core C direction from an inner peripheral surface a of a cylindrical part  so as not to overlap with each other in the axial core C direction where the cylinder part is provided in the lower case SELECTED DRAWING Figure
