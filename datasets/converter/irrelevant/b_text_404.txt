 USB Technologies to improve band edge channel performance for radios are described One device includes a baseband processor with an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM physical layer PHY parameter structure The OFDM PHY layer parameter structure includes first parameter information that controls operation of an OFDM PHY in a first mode The baseband processor establishes a wireless communication link with a second device and transmits first data to the second device in the first mode using a transmit power level The baseband processor determines that the device is connected with the second device on a band edge channel that is adjacent to a restricted frequency band The baseband processor modifies the first parameter information to second parameter information the second parameter information controls operation of the OFDM PHY in a second mode The baseband processor transmits transmit second data to the second device in the second mode using the transmit power level
