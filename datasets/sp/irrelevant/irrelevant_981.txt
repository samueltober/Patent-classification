 CNB The invention discloses a sliding mode adaptive control method of a nonlinear active hydraulic suspension system and belongs to the technical field of vehicle suspensions The sliding mode adaptive control method comprises the following steps of  establishing a nonlinear active suspension model by considering an asymmetric singlerod hydraulic actuator  deriving a sliding mode adaptive controller by considering system uncertainty parameters and external disturbance  designing an expansion state observer and designing a state observer for the suspension system to observe the wheel movement speed and the pressure in a hydraulic cylinder cavity and  adjusting system parameters According to the invention the state observer is designed for observing the state quantity required by the controller so that even if external uncertain disturbance exists in the system and the vertical movement speed of the wheels and the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder cavity cannot be measured the vertical displacement acceleration and the pitch angle acceleration of the vehicle body can still well isolate the influence brought by road surface excitation and the system reaches a stable state
