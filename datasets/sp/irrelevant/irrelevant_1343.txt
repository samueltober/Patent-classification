 CNA The invention provides a pressuredisplacement integrated control system and method based on a rocker arm suspension The control system comprises the rocker arm suspension a hydraulic system an angular displacement sensor a pressure sensor and a controller The controller judges the state of the rocker arm suspension by the rocker arm position collected by the angular displacement sensor ofthe rocker arm suspension and the oil chamber pressure collected by the pressure sensor the rocker arm suspension is located in the static load pressure increase or decrease direction of a bearing chamber and according to the state of the rocker arm suspension the controller controls the hydraulic system to push a rocker arm to rotate to the set target location and adjusts the pressure of the bearing chamber to the target pressure value in a coordinated manner and thus pressuredisplacement integrated control is completed The control stability the rapidity and accuracy of the rocker armsuspension can be improved
