 CNB The invention discloses an active suspension using a rubber spring in the field of vehicle suspensions The lower end of an inner cylinder of an active force actuator extends out of an outer cylinderand is concentrically and fixedly connected with the rubber spring a rigid upper bottom plate is at the top of the rubber spring a rigid lower bottom plate is at the bottom of the rubber spring a rubber main spring and a rigid partition plate are arranged between the rigid upper bottom plate and the rigid lower bottom plate the lower surface of the rubber main spring closely sticks to the upper surface of the rigid lower bottom plate the upper surface of the rubber main spring supports the rigid partition plate a clearance is reserved between the rigid partition plate and the rigid upperbottom plate an arc groove is formed in the right middle of the upper surface of the rubber main spring after a rigid inner tube which is placed in the frontandback direction penetrates through the arc groove the front and back ends of the rigid inner tube are both fixedly connected to the upper end of an inner tube mounting seat the lower end of the inner tube mounting seat is rigidly connected with a lower fork arm and the lower fork arm is connected between a vehicle body and a wheel Except for a primary vibration absorbing function formed by the active force actuator and the spiral spring the active suspension using the rubber spring also has a secondary vibration absorbing function formed by the rubber spring
