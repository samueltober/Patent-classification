 JPA To reduce a backlash between a power transmission shaft and a hub ring with a structure which enables easy processing and assemblySOLUTION A connection structure between a power transmission shaft  and a hub ring  includes a power transmission shaft  of a constantvelocity universal joint  and a shaft hole  of the hub ring  which are splined to each other a nut  which is screwed into one axial end of the power transmission shaft  protruding from the shaft hole  a protruding part  provided on a nut end surface a facing the other axial end side of the nut  and a recessed part  provided on a hub end surface a facing the one axial end side of the hub ring  and forming an annular shape around an axis Fitting between the protruding part  and the recessed part  causes the nut  to press an inner diameter part  of the hub ring  to an outer periphery of the power transmission shaft SELECTED DRAWING Figure
