 CNU The utility model discloses a suspension device for a hub motor of a commercial vehicle The device comprises a guide mechanism and an active control system the guide mechanism is of an unequallength doublecrossarm structure and comprises an upper cross arm assembly a lower cross arm assembly and a stand column assembly the stand column assembly is connected with the hub motor assembly through a bearing the length ratio of the upper cross arm assembly to the lower cross arm assembly ranges from  to  and a large flat plate space can be provided between hubs on the two sides through the ultrashort upper cross arm assembly The upper cross arm assembly the lower cross arm assembly and the stand column assembly are connected with the stand column assembly through pin shafts andopposed tapered roller bearings and can bear large loads The active control system comprises an air spring assembly a damping shock absorber assembly an ECU and a plurality of sensors the ECU controls the rigidity of the air spring assembly and the damping of the damping shock absorber assembly in real time through the sensors the influence that due to the fact that the unsprung mass is increased the running smoothness of the whole vehicle becomes poor is avoided and meanwhile the operation stability of the whole vehicle is improved
