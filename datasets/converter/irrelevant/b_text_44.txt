 EPB The present invention provides a coupled inductor and a power converter The coupled inductor includes at least two input ends an output end a common magnetic core at least two first windings and at least two second windings The common magnetic core includes at least two cylinders and the number of the at least two cylinders corresponds to the number of the at least two input ends and one first winding and one second winding are twined in parallel on each cylinder among the at least two cylinders and the first windings and the second windings on the at least two cylinders are mutually connected between the at least two input ends and the output end to form mutually coupled inductances and when currents that flow into the at least two input ends are equal make the first winding and the second winding on each cylinder generate opposite magnetic potentials In technical solutions of the present invention the first winding and the second winding on each cylinder generate opposite magnetic potentials when currents that flow into the input ends are equal In this way the magnetic potentials generated by common mode currents offset each other so that a magnetic leakage is reduced
