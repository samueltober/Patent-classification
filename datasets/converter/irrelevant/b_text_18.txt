 GBB A power converter comprises a plurality of energy storage devices ESDs charged by a power source and sequentially coupled and decoupled to an output where at least two of the ESDs are maintained at different potentials A branch  of the converter includes a first arm  and a second arm  Each arm includes a number of modules  each module including a number of individually controllable switching valves and an ESD The ESD may be a capacitor or any suitable element capable of storing energy and discharging energy by virtue of an electrical potential The first and second arms may be connected between two DC rails  An AC terminal  an output of the converter may be positioned between the first and second arm and each may include an inductor   to help limit current transients in the converter during operation The arrangement may be used where power is generated by offshore wind turbines and the power generated must be transmitted onshore by long lengths of subsea cabling
