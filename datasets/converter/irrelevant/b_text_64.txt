 CNA The invention relates to a method for controlling a highvoltage directcurrent network  comprising highvoltage power lines       first to third conversion stations   each comprising a directcurrent network interface comprising first and second poles    at least two ACDC converters   connected between the alternatingcurrent network interface and the directcurrent network interface a control device  accessing a database storing a maximum intensity value at the nominal voltage and the corresponding growth time for each ofthe converters the control device determines an increased power to be exchanged for compensation on the second pole of the stations in the event of a fault on one of the highvoltage lines connectedto the first pole based on the defective pole and based on the values stored in the database
