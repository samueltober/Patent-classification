 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To reduce abrasion of a seal lip part to enhance reliability in a rotation seal where an uneven surface is formed on a slide surface of a slinger on which the seal lip part of a seal member slidesSOLUTION A rotation seal  comprises a core grid  a seal member  where a base part A is connected to the core grid  and having seal lip parts B C D and a slinger  having slide surfaces A B on which the seal lip parts B C D slide The slide surfaces is in a surface state where according to JIS B  the following relation expressions are satisfied arithmetic average roughness Ra is  mRa m skewness Rsk of a roughness curve is Rsk and average length RSm of a roughness curve element is  mRSmSELECTED DRAWING Figure
