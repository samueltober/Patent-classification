 KRA The present invention relates to an ABS device and a bearing structure provided in the ABS device The ABS device is able to prevent an axle from being locked when the rev count of the axle is reduced by a brake The axle comprises an external rotation unit coming in contact with a wheel and having a disc in friction with a brake and a bearing unit fixed on a knuckle and having an external rotation unit rotatably mounted thereon The present invention is able to calculate the rotary speed of the axle and the rotary speed of the knuckle from signals from a wheel speed sensor placed on the knuckle to which the axle is connected and from a gyro sensor placed on a rotary central shaft of the bearing unit to control the operation of the brake in accordance with a rotary speed correction value which is obtained by subtracting the rotary speed of the knuckle from the rotary speed of the axle and to prevent the misjudgment of the possibility of a tire slip or wheel lock which are an operational condition for the ABS device even if a rotation occurs on the knuckle in accordance with the ground surface condition and the driving situation
