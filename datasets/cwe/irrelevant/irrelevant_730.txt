 JPA To realize a configuration of a hub unit bearing which can sufficiently secure sealing performance by an outside sealing member even if polishing processing is applied to a lip slide contact face of a hub by using a rotary brushSOLUTION As an outside sealing member there is employed a member having an outside lip a and an inside lip a and an external peripheral face of a hub comprises a first slide contact face a in which a circular arcshaped first polishing mark  for making the outside lip  slidecontact therewith is formed and a second slide contact face a in which a circular arcshaped second polishing mark  for making the inside lip a slidecontact therewith is formed A width h of the first polishing mark  in a radial direction is equal to or narrower than a width H of a first slide contact part  in the radial direction being a slide contact range of the outside lip a with respect to the first slide contact face a and a width h of the second polishing mark  in an axial direction is equal to or narrower than a width H of a second slide contact part  in the axial direction being a slide contact range of the inside lip a with respect to the second slide contact face aSELECTED DRAWING Figure
