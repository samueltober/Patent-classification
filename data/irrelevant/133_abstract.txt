The present invention discloses a method and a system of damping control for reduction of inverter parallel resonance The method and the system employ a duallayer control strategy upperlayer control selects one appropriate enabling inverter from each inverter according to one charge state of one direct current side power supply of each inverter in a multiinverter parallel system and lowerlayer control arranges a virtual resistance control ring in a working circuit of the enabling inverter so as to perform active damping control for the enabling inverter and achieve resonance inhibitionof the multiinverter parallel system The method and the system only need to perform active damping control for one inverter to achieve resonance inhibition of all the inverters a current measurement link of a network system is employed to perform parameter calculation in the process of achieving damping control of the inverters and therefore the fewest circuit modules are introduced to achieve inhibition of multiinverter parallel resonance and the system cost is greatly reduced
