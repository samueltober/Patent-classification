 CNB The invention discloses a timevarying compensation control system for damper mechanical characteristics of a magnetorheological semiactive suspension and a construction method of the timevarying compensation control system The output ends of a sprung mass acceleration sensor and a wheel mass acceleration sensor are connected to an extended Kalman filter and the output end of the extended Kalman filter is connected to a softconstraint Taylor series LQG timedelay compensation controller The softconstraint Taylor series LQG timedelay compensation controller is connected with a timedelay compensation prediction controller and a semiactive power acquisition controller separately and the timedelay compensation prediction controller is connected to the input end of the softconstraint Taylor series LQG timedelay compensation controller The semiactive power acquisition controller is connected with the extended Kalman filter and a control current solution controller separatelythe control current solution controller is connected to a numerical control current source to realize the compensation control over damper response time delay and mechanical characteristic time variation of the magnetorheological semiactive suspension the situation that a hardconstraint Taylor series LQG timedelay compensation control method directly utilizes a saturation function to performhard constraint on the predictive control force can be avoided and thus a more ideal timedelay compensation control effect can be achieved
