 CNA The invention discloses an independent suspension mechanism for an AGV and the heavyload AGV The independent suspension mechanism comprises a driving part a shock absorber and a swing rod The driving part is connected with wheels through a transmission shaft one end of the shock absorber is connected with a frame body and the other end is hinged to one end of the swing rod the swing rod sleeves the transmission shaft and can rotate around the transmission shaft the other end of the swing rod is hinged with the frame body and the included angle between the shock absorber and the horizontal plane is smaller than a set angle The shock absorber is approximately horizontally arranged the frame body does not need to extend towards the upper portion of the driving unit any more and compared with the vertical shock absorption design the lower height of the frame body and the better structural rigidity can be achieved and compared with vertical arrangement under the condition that the rigidity coefficients of the springs are the same and the weight of the frame body is the same due to the fact that the force arm is reduced larger displacement can be generated in the vertical direction and the better damping effect can be achieved
