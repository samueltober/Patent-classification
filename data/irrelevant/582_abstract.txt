The invention discloses a largescale digital array signal synchronous acquisition system and aims to provide a synchronous acquisition system which is high in reliability expandable in scale highin synchronization precision good in amplitude consistency and phase consistency rapid and stable According to the system each subarray group is directly connected with a synchronous sampling analogtodigital AD converter through a highspeed serial interface at a collection end synchronous sampling of array signals is achieved a delay measurement module is triggered to perform phase relation detection through intersubarray synchronous moments effective collection moment periods of synchronous signals are searched in a delay mode Reliable alignment of sampling clocks and synchronizing signals is achieved through twostage clock distribution and delay measurement in each subarray reference clocks and digital multibeam synchronizing signals between the subarrays are transmitted and distributed to a DBF processing pool through optical fibers and the DBF processing pool completes beam data aggregation according to the array scale And the multibeam data forming the full array are sent to baseband signal processing equipment to realize measurement control and communication
