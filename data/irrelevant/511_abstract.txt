A DCDC power converter including switched inductance circuits arranged in parallel is described Operation includes determining a commanded current and activation commands for the switched inductance circuits based upon the commanded current This includes executing the activation commands and monitoring current in the switched inductance circuits An average measured current is determined for each of the switched inductance circuits and a modified activation command is determined for each of the switched inductance circuits based upon the average measured current A time portion of the modified activation command that exceeds an end time point of a subsequent time period is determined and the modified activation commands for the switched inductance circuits are executed including forwardshifting that time portion of the modified activation command for each of the switched inductance circuits that exceeds the end time point
