 CNU The front control arm comprises a base and two front control arm bodies semicircular rings are symmetrically and fixedly connected to the upper end of the base one ends of the two front control armbodies are rotatably connected with the upper ends of the semicircular rings supporting columns are evenly distributed at the upper end of the base and the other ends of the two front control armbodies are fixedly connected with the upper ends of the supporting columns The two ends of each front control arm body are fixedly connected to the upper end of one supporting column respectively The connecting structure of the two front control arms is arranged so that a product of the traction arm body is large in forging deformation and small in vertical tolerance the installation quality of the automobile rear wheel hub can be guaranteed when the automobile rear wheel hub is connected meanwhile the front control arm body belongs to a flexible clamp and can be machined and formed at atime and the production efficiency is improved The front control arm can adapt to machining of various deformed parts so that the bearing capacity of the front control arm body is increased a rear wheel hub is better supported and the front control arm body is not prone to breakage
