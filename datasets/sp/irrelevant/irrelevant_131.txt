 USA An electric drive system including a rotary motor system including a hub assembly a first rotating assembly a second rotating assembly and a third rotating assembly wherein the hub assembly defines a rotational axis about which the first rotating assembly the second rotating assembly and the third rotating assembly are coaxially aligned and are capable of independent rotational movement independent of each other a multibar linkage mechanism connected to each of the first and third rotating assemblies and connected to the hub assembly and constraining movement of the hub assembly so that the rotational axis of the hub assembly moves along a defined path that is in a transverse direction relative to the rotational axis and wherein the multibar linkage mechanism causes the rotational axis of the hub assembly to translate along the defined path in response to relative rotation of the first rotating assembly and the third rotating assembly with respect to each other
