A METHOD FOR MODULAR MULTILEVEL CONVERTER INVERTER OPEN CIRCUIT FAULT IDENTIFICATION AND POSITIONING Aspects of the present disclosure relate to method  for identifying and positioning open  circuit faults of multilevel inverter The Modular Multilevel Converter MMC is a power electronic structure used for high voltage adjustable speed drives applications as well as power transmission applications and highvoltage direct current MMC structure presents many advantages such as modularity the absence of a high voltage DC bus and very low switching frequency An ESO based fault detection and location  method  is  proposed which features a low computation burden and relatively quick fault detection and location  In this method the voltage difference  between the ESO and theoretical voltages is used for setting  plurality of sampling points against the output current From these sampling points the information is acquired  The proposed fault diagnosis strategy features a low computation burden and relatively fast speed in fault detection and  location  as it uses machine learning models based on multivariate gaussian distribution FIG  will be the reference figure    aippiican name rage i   acquiring theoretical full ann voltage by a  calculator acquiring ESO full arm voltage by an ESO  calculating the difference between the theoretical full am voltage and ESO full arm voltage setting plurality of sampling point  acquiring current sampling information  identifying the openeircuit fault  finding the location of the opencircuit fault using f  a fault detection and location FDL method FIG  Flow diagram of method for identifying and positioning opencircuit faults of multilevel inverter
