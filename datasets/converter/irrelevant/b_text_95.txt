 CNB The invention discloses a power converter comprising a forestage DCDC converter and a rear stage linear voltage regulator cascaded in connection the DCDC converter is used for receiving a current sampling signal representing a load current size stacking the current sampling signal with a preset first reference voltage so as to obtain a reference signal and forming an intermediate voltage according to the reference signal the linear voltage regulator is used for receiving the intermediate voltage thus enabling the difference between the input voltage and output voltage of the linear voltage regulator to be equal to or bigger than the linear voltage regulator differential voltage requirement A current sampling circuit can return load current changes to the DCDC converter thus adjusting the intermediate voltage forming a linear relation between the linear voltage regulator differential voltage and the load current reducing the extra power consumption waste under a light load and realizing highly efficient conversion of the linear voltage regulator in a full load scope
