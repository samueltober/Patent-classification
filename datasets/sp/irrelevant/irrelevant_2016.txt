 CNA     The invention discloses a climbing method for an active suspension planetary vehicle The active suspension planetary vehicle is composed of wheels with independent steering and a suspension capable of actively adjusting the height of the vehicle body The method is using the active suspension planetary vehicle The multiwheel independent steering feature of the car allows the body to maintain the direction of the front of the car directly uphill The steering of each wheel rotates the same angle in the same direction After climbing for a certain distance each wheel turns to the other direction and rotates the same angle and then climbs In this way a zigzag uphill route is realized the rotation angle of the wheels is  The zigzag climbing route of the present invention has no direct upward climbing process in the whole process reduces the traction during the climbing process and improves the climbing ability of the planetary vehicle and the stability of the vehicle body Utilizing the liftable feature of the active suspension planetary vehicle suspension the height of the vehicle body is reduced and the stability of the vehicle body under extreme conditions is increased
