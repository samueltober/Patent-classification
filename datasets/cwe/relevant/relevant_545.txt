 JPA To apply a coating or the like on an entire surface of a bearing device by a simple method without the necessity for applying processing such as masking to a sealing deviceSOLUTION A bearing device  has an outer member  an inner member  and a plurality of rolling bodies  A sealing device  is arranged at an end part of a bearing internal space K between the outer member  and the inner member  The bearing device  has an annular clearance s in which the outer member  and the inner member  are formed while approximating each other and the sealing device  has a seal internal space E which is opened in the annular clearance s and communicates therewith in a peripheral direction A manufacturing method has a spray process for spraying a coating agent for coating an outer face of the bearing device  together with air in at least one point of a region including the clearance s and an airsending process for sending air to the seal internal space E via the clearance s in a point separated from the one point The spray process and the airsending process are simultaneously performedSELECTED DRAWING Figure
