This application provides a method and device for asynchronous adjustment of a UHV DC transmission converter transformer tap The UHV DC transmission system includes at least one DC pole The DC pole includes a highend valve group and a lowend valve group connected in series When the converter requires the converter transformer to adjust the tap the method includes determining the highend valve group and the lowend valve group The absolute value of the difference between the noload DC voltage of the converter of the end valve group or the absolute value of the difference between the effective value of the valve side AC voltage of the converter transformer connected to the converter of the highend valve group and the converter of the lowend valve group The absolute value is less than or equal to the preset threshold and only one of the highend valve group and the lowend valve group is allowed to adjust the gear up and the other one is adjusted down in response to the absolute value being greater than the preset threshold Only allow the valve group where the noload DC voltage or the valve side AC voltage has a small effective value to adjust the gear upwards or the valve group where the noload DC voltage or the valve side AC voltage of the large effective value of the converter is located downwards Adjust the gear
