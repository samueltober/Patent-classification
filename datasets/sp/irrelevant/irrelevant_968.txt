 CNU The utility model particularly relates to a novel express delivery trolley frame which is good in driving stability and simple in structure the frame comprises a horizontal frame stand columns are welded to the bottom of each oblique beam of the horizontal frame in the length direction of the horizontal frame and the lower end faces of the stand columns are connected with a motor support The axes of the four motor brackets are distributed in the horizontal frame in an X shape a motor is placed in an inner cavity of the motor bracket a certain included angle is formed between the axis ofthe lower swing arm and the running direction of the trolley in the horizontal plane when the trolley moves forwards or backwards the upper swing arm and the lower swing arm can swing to stabilize the trolley when a certain omnidirectional wheel encounters an obstacle and similarly when the trolley moves leftwards or rightwards the upper swing arm and the lower swing arm can swing to stabilize the trolley when the omnidirectional wheel encounters the obstacle
