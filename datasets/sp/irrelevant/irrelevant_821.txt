 CNU The utility model discloses a threewire sixshaft suspension for vehicle machinery Suspension and ball bearing connecting blocks are arranged on the two sides of the suspension Balance beams are installed on the two sides of the connecting block A sliding groove is formed in the side close to the balance beam of the connecting block A sliding block is fixed to the side close to the sliding groove of the balance beam ball grooves are formed in the two sides of the sliding block the balls are located in the ball grooves wheel shafts are connected to the two sides of the middle of the balance beam limiting rods are installed on the sides close to the balance beam of the wheel shafts and damping springs are installed on the sides away from the balance beam of the wheel shafts According to the threewire sixshaft suspension for the vehicle machinery the sliding grooves and the sliding blocks are arranged through a sliding structure the situation that when a single wheel shaft is vibrated damping cannot be effectively conducted due to the influence of the length of the balance beam is avoided the single wheel shaft moves up and down through the balance beam connection between the balance beam and the connecting blocks is more flexible and damping springs can conduct damping more effectively
