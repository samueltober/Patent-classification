 CNA The invention provides a suspension height adjusting method a suspension system and a vehicle and relates to the field of vehicle parts and the method comprises a calibration step obtaining the suspension height at a somatosensory comfortable vibration frequency according to the somatosensory comfortable vibration frequency of the vehicle and defining the suspension height as a calibrated suspension height an acquisition step acquiring the realtime suspension height of the vehicle and defining the realtime suspension height as the realtime suspension height a comparison step comparing the realtime suspension height with the calibrated suspension height and determining whether the realtime suspension height is the same as the calibrated suspension height or not an adjustingstep if the realtime suspension height is the same as the calibrated suspension height repeating the collecting step and the comparing step and if the realtime suspension height is different from the calibrated suspension height adjusting the realtime suspension height to be the calibrated suspension height and repeating the collection step and the comparison step The realtime suspension height is adjusted to be the calibrated suspension height when a vehicle runs the comfortable somatosensory vibration frequency can be provided for passengers all the time and the riding comfortof the passengers is ensured
