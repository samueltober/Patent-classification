 WOA In the present invention an Nnumber of parallelly connected DCDC converters N N is  or more is provided with a first converter group that executes PWM switching at a first carrier and a second converter group that executes PWM switching at a second carrier different in phase from the first carrier One or more DCDC converters N are allocated to each of the converter groups a plurality of operation modes for setting the number of converters to be operated and the converter group are provided switching is executed among the operation modes through comparison of the total output of the Nnumber of DCDC converters with a preset threshold value and the ratio of the total output of the first converter group to that of the second converter group is set within a predetermined range
