 DEA     A method for producing a bearing element  coated with a coating  made of elastomer material is shown and described with the following steps Provision of an injection molding device  which in the closed position encloses a cavity  the molded parts a b c of which have an inner surface  provided with a surface structure  Inserting a mold core  into the cavity  so that a gap  remains which corresponds to the shape of the coating  of the support element  to be produced Inserting a first mixture  into the gap  so that the first mixture  fills the gap  and forms a shell  which has the shape of the coating  the first Mixture  also fills the surface structure  vulcanizing the shell  removing the mold core  Injection of a second mixture  into the cavity  so that it forms a support body  which rests against the inside of the shell  Vulcanizing the support body  together with the shell  so that these are connected to one another and the shell  forms the coating  of the support body
