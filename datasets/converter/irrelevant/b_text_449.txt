 CNB The invention relates to a DCAC converter technology and particularly relates to a multilevel singlestage DCAC converter The multilevel singlestage DCAC converter comprises a DC power supplya bidirectional power switch a multitap transformer and a PWM signal and driving unit wherein a primary side of the multitap transformer is provided with a plurality of taps taps and turns of anupper half winding and a lower half winding are symmetrically distributed by taking the middle tap as a reference one end of the bidirectional power switch is connected with an anode of the DC powersupply the other end is connected with each tap of the multitap transformer a cathode of the DC power supply is connected with the center tap of the multitap transformer and the PWM signal and driving unit is used for generating a control signal required by the bidirectional power switch The DCAC converter enables different windings of the transformer to be shortcircuited to the same directcurrent power supply by controlling on and off of the power switch tube so that a multilevel output voltage is obtained at an output end of the transformer The multilevel singlestage DCAC converter has advantages of low output voltage harmonic content small electromagnetic interference dispersed power loss high efficiency and the like
