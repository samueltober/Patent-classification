The power converter  comprises a power converter  including a plurality of arms   having a plurality of converter cells  cascaded to each other The control device  is between the AC current control unit  that controls the AC current Iac flowing between the power converter  and the AC circuit  and the arm of the power converter  It includes a circulating current control unit  that controls the circulating current Iz flowing through the circuit The AC current control unit  is in the discharge operation mode in which the voltage of the power storage element  of the converter cell  is discharged and the effective value or amplitude of the AC current Iac is higher than in the normal operation mode Decrease the value The circulating current control unit  increases the effective value or amplitude value of the circulating current Iz in the discharge operation mode as compared with the normal operation mode
