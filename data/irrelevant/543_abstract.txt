The invention relates to the technical field of inverters in particular to a doublefrequency transformerfree singlephase photovoltaic gridconnected inverter which comprises an inverter shell a circuit board is arranged in the inverter shell and a control unit and a main loop unit are arranged on the circuit board the main loop unit is divided into a power unit and a resonance elimination unit and the resonance elimination unit and the power unit are connected to two sides of a singlephase power grid in parallel the bus cathode of the resonance elimination unit is connected with thebus cathode of the power unit through a connecting capacitor the LA terminal and the LB terminal of the power unit are connected to the L terminal and the N terminal of a power grid through a power filter The HA terminal and the HB terminal of the resonance elimination unit are connected to the L terminal and the N terminal of the power grid through a resonance elimination filter to form the main loop unit through a novel topological structure and a control algorithm the ground leakage current of the transformerless gridconnected inverter is effectively suppressed and meanwhile the overall efficiency and the power density of the inverter are improved
