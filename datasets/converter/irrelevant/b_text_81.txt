 USB A controller for use in a twostage power supply is coupled to control switching of a switching element to regulate a transfer of energy from an input to an output of a flyback converter The controller activates a boost switching element during a first interval in each line half cycle of an input voltage to boost an output voltage at an output of a boostbypass converter The controller deactivates the boost switching element during a second interval in each line half cycle such that the output voltage of the boostbypass converter drops towards the input voltage during the second interval while the output voltage of the boostbypass converter is greater than the input voltage The controller controls the output voltage to follow the input voltage during a third interval of each line half cycle while the boost switching element remains deactivated and the input and output voltages are substantially equal
