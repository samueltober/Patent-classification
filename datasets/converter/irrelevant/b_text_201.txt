 CNA Provided is a highfrequency power generator with an enhanced pulse function which supplies highfrequency power to a plasma load The highfrequency power generator includes a rectifier a DCDC converter a radio frequency power amplifier an RF power controller and a DCDC converter controller The DCDC converter controller comprises a first subtractor a first proportional integral controller a second subtractor a second proportional integral controller a comparator that generates a pulse width modulated signal by comparing the output of the second proportional integral controllerwith a carrier frequency and provides the generated pulse width modulation signal to switch components for forming the DCDC converter and an adaptive controller that receives a pulse signal corresponding to the output of the RF power amplifier from the RF power controller to adjust the gains of the first proportional integral controller and the second proportional integral controller
