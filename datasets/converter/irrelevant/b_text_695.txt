 USA The present document relates to power converters A power converter has a first stage coupled between an input of the power converter and an intermediate node and a second stage coupled between the intermediate node and an output of the power converter The first stage has a capacitive voltage divider with a first flying capacitor and the second stage has a second flying capacitor and an inductor On the one hand the power converter establishes in a magnetizing state a magnetizing current path in the second stage from the intermediate node via the inductor to the output of the power converter On the other hand the power converter establishes in a capacitive state a parallel current path in the second stage from the intermediate node via the second flying capacitor to the output of the power converter
