 CNU The utility model discloses an active magnetic suspension wheel which relates to the field of traffic and vehicles can replace the existing suspension system structure with a magnetic bearing structure avoids mechanical friction and reduces energy loss The magnetic bearing comprises a radial magnetic bearing stator a radial magnetic bearing rotor an axial magnetic bearing stator an axial magnetic bearing rotor a central shaft a sleeve a flange plate and a hub According to the structure the radial magnetic bearing stator and the vehicle chassis are stably suspended in the air through electromagnetic force and friction loss of a traditional bearing is eliminated And the air gap between the radial stator and the radial rotor is much larger than that of a common magnetic bearingand reaches several millimeters a spring and a damper of a traditional suspension can be replaced with electromagnetic suspension force and suppression of bumping of a vehicle body and change of damping characteristics in the vehicle running process are achieved through an active control method
