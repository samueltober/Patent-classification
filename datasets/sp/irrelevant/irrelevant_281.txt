 CNB The invention discloses an active suspension using an air spring assembly in the technical field of vehicle suspensions The lower end of an inner cylinder of an active force actuator extends out of an outer cylinder and is concentrically and fixedly connected with the air spring assembly the air spring assembly has two air springs which have same structures and are symmetrically placed with oneunder the other a rigid inner tube which is placed in the frontandback direction is arranged between the two air springs the central axis of the rigid inner tube is perpendicularly intersected with that of the active force actuator the front and back ends of the rigid inner tube are fixedly connected with the upper end of an inner tube mounting seat the lower end of the inner tube mounting seat is rigidly connected with a lower fork arm the lower fork arm is connected between a vehicle body and a wheel and a damping tube is connected between two airbags in a sealed manner and is in communication with the two airbags According to the active suspension using the air spring assembly the air spring assembly has a vibration absorbing function except for a connecting function and except for a primary vibration absorbing function formed by the active force actuator and the spiral spring the active suspension using the air spring assembly also has a secondary vibration absorbing function formed by the air spring assembly
