The invention discloses a risk conduction evaluation method for largescale weapon equipment manufacturing which includes  determining the module procedures of the manufacturing process  using the module procedures as the analysis unit to decompose risk events to form a risk identification matrix  data on risk events The evaluation forms the probability level and consequence level dual language variable decision information  Converts to the intuitive normal cloud model quantitative information  Builds a panoramic influence diagram of risk transmission conducts risk transmission analysis and calculates schedule andor cost andor The risk impact value contribution degree and total risk impact value of the quality risk node and risk grading based on the calculation results The present invention proposes a risk identification method based on WBSRBS and provides the steps of transforming bilingual variable decision information into quantitative information of intuitive normal cloud model it gives a panoramic view from the topological layer the function layer and the numerical layer The construction and solution method of risk transmission influence diagram is a fast simple and accurate risk evaluation method
