 USB A method includes operating a power converter in a first mode of operation where the power converter includes multiple first switches and multiple boost diodes coupled to multiple first rails Each first rail is also coupled to a different one of multiple boost inductors and the power converter is coupled to multiple second rails The power converter in the first mode converts electrical power transported between the first and second rails The method also includes during the first mode of operation operating multiple second switches coupled in parallel across the boost diodes as synchronous switches Each second switch is coupled across a different one of the boost diodes The method further includes switching the power converter to a second mode of operation in which the first switches are deactivated and the second switches and the boost diodes operate as a fullbridge power converter
