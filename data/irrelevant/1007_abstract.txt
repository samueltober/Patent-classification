An analogtodigital conversion system may include an analogtodigital converter configured to convert an analog input signal into an equivalent digital input signal a first filtering path configured to filter the equivalent digital input signal to generate a first filtered digital signal wherein the first filtering path comprises a zeroovershoot monotonic step response filter a second filtering path configured to filter the equivalent digital input signal to generate a second filtered digital signal wherein the second filtering path comprises a frequencyselective filter and a mixer configured to either i select between the first filtered digital signal and the second filtered digital signal in order to generate an output digital signal or ii combine selected proportions of each of the first filtered digital signal and the second filtered digital signal in order to generate the output digital signal
