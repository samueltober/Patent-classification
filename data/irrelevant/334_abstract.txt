Methods systems and computer readable media are disclosed for monitoring electric systems for wiring faults In some examples a system includes a production power meter coupled to a power generation system of a building and configured for measuring electric power generated by the power generation system one or more consumption power meters coupled to an electric system of the building and configured for measuring electric power consumed by the electric system and a computer system coupled to the production power meter and the consumption power meters The computer system is programmed for determining that at least one power meter is installed with a reversed polarity that is reversed with respect to an installation specification resulting in the computer system receiving measured values from the at least one power meter having an incorrect sign
