The invention belongs to the technical field of nuclear power station reactor control systems The invention provides a control method and a control device for the average temperature of a nuclear reactor of a nuclear power station According to the control method the maximum nuclear power value of a plurality of nuclear power signals outside a nuclear reactor is introduced a temperature correction signal is generated according to the maximum power value of a steam turbine and the maximum nuclear power value and the temperature correction signal is combined into an average temperature setting value and an average temperature maximum value to jointly adjust a control rod Therefore the temperature correction signal is added to jointly adjust the control rod on the basis that the averagetemperature of the nuclear reactor is adjusted according to the average temperature setting value and the average temperature maximum value in other words the average temperature is adjusted according to the difference change between the power absorbed by the steam turbine and the power generated by the nuclear reactor and the problem that in a traditional nuclear reactor average temperature control method due to the fact that only the average temperature setting value and the average temperature maximum value are used for adjustment adjustment hysteresis exists is solved
