 CNB The invention discloses an Smode responder based on avionics integrated architecture reconstruction and a design method thereof The Smode responder responds to the inquiry sent by a secondary surveillance radar interrogator and makes a response and comprises an integrated antenna a universal antenna interface unit a radio frequency switch matrix unit a universal receiving and exciting unita universal signal processing unit and a universal information processing unit a discrete line is arranged between a multipole switch of the receiving and exciting unit and the universal signal processing unit an FPGA logic identifies a PP pulse pair for performing response encoding generating a response number intermediate frequency signal converting the signal into a small power ratio frequency response signal and making the signal reach the multipole switch and it is judged whether or not a P pulse exists so that the judgment result reaches the multipole switch through the discrete line The Smode responder based on the avionics integrated architecture reconstruction and the design method thereof have the advantages that a serial processing mode is changed into a parallelprocessing mode  microseconds of waiting time of the serial processing is saved so that the requirements for a normal mode response delay indicator are satisfied the cost is low and the implementation is easy
