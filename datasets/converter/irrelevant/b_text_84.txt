 USB Systems and methods of diagnosing opencircuit fault in power converters receives a neutral point current value a switching state of the power converter and load current values At least one fault condition is identified based upon the switching state of the power converter and the load current values The neutral point current value current value is compared to the at least one fault condition An open circuit fault is determined to be present at the switching state of the power converter based upon the comparison
