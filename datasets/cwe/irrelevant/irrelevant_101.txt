 CNU A novel parallel interaxle differential transmission rear axle comprises an axle housing an input shaft a differential mechanism half axle housings and half axles the input shaft is horizontallyarranged on the upper portion of the inner side of the axle housing the differential mechanism is arranged on the lower portion of the input shaft in the axle housing the half axle housings are arranged on the lower portions of the two sides of the axle housing in a bilateral symmetry mode and the half axles are arranged in the half axle housings The axle housing is a rectangular box with theupper end open a connecting flange is arranged on the outer side of the upper end face of the axle housing and input shaft through holes are formed in the upper portions of the left side face and the right side face of the axle housing in a bilateral symmetry mode The technical scheme is adopted a good effect is achieved the novel differential transmission rear axle between the parallel shafts is matched with a gear ring on the outer side of a differential mechanism through a common input pinion Small half axle gears on the two sides of the differential mechanism are meshed with half axle large gears on half axles the load of differential gears in the differential mechanism is effectively reduced a doublebevel gear of an input shaft is omitted the manufacturing difficulty and manufacturing cost of the gears are reduced and benefits are brought to enterprises
