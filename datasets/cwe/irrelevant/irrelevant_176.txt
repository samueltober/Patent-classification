 CNU The utility model discloses an antirust electrotricycle hub which relates to the technical field of electrotricycles and comprises a hub body and an antirust mechanism is mounted in the hub body The utility model discloses an anticorrosion hub of an electric tricycle The protection ring can be better inserted into the mounting hole during mounting therefore the screw is inserted into the protection ring therefore the hub body is mounted in the fixing groove through the screw cap the influence on the dismounting effect due to rusting of the contact part of the screw at the mounting part and the screw hole in the use process can be avoided the influence on the safety of the hub during rotation due to corrosion is prevented according to the hub mounting device the inserting columns are better inserted into the inserting grooves so that the stabilizing columns are pushed to be clamped into the stabilizing grooves through tension of the springs the protective shell is stably mounted screw caps can be better protected the problem of corrosion in the using process is avoided and the anticorrosion effect of the hub mounting device on the hub mounting part is improved
