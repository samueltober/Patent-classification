 CNA The invention discloses an adjustable hub for a trailer The adjustable hub comprises a plateshaped shell and an annular hub frame wherein a tire is mounted on the side surface of the annular hub frame A plurality of steel bars and the annular hub frame are movably connected and the property that the two ends of each steel bar can play a supporting role when the steel bars contract inwards isutilized so that the symmetrical upward supporting effect on the hub frame is achieved and the impact resistance of the hub frame is improved meanwhile when the multiple steel bars contract contraction driving is conducted through internal air negative pressure so that the steel bars are the same in force when contracting and due to the fact that the contraction force of the steel bars is the same the upward supporting force formed by changing the spatial positions of the steel bars is the same the steel bars with different sizes are changed into the property that the steel bars are different in supporting angles the supporting force is not affected the supporting force of the steel bars is consistent therefore the impact resistance of each part of the annular hub is consistent and the protection effect on parts is improved
