 CNA The invention discloses a fuzzy switching control method for an electric control system for a damping multimode semiactive suspension Firstly sprung mass acceleration and unsprung mass acceleration are obtained by utilizing a sensor and obtained acceleration signals are integrated to obtain speed and displacement signals of sprung mass and unsprung mass The speed and displacement signals arefurther processed as a judgment basis of tension and compression states of a suspension and are used as input signals of a fuzzy controller to carry out fuzzy judgment and opening and closing signals of two highspeed onoff solenoid valves of the suspension are output The opening and closing signals control onoff states of the highspeed onoff solenoid valves so that the suspension can provide a good vibration damping effect regardless of the state of a vehicle According to the method a good damping switching control effect of a suspension system can be realized the defect that the traditional control calculation amount is large is avoided by utilizing the fuzzy control and the vehicle driving smoothness is improved
