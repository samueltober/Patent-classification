 CNU An antitoppling frame assembly comprises a main frame a steering system is arranged in front of the main frame a rear axle is arranged behind the main frame and comprises a long shaft fixedly connected with the main frame the long shaft is obliquely arranged in the backward direction a shaft sleeve capable of rotating around the long shaft is arranged outside the long shaft and limiting blocks are arranged at the upper end and the lower end of the long shaft The shaft sleeve is arranged between the limiting blocks the upper end and the lower end of the shaft sleeve are connected with the supporting frame through a plurality of connecting rods the rear wheels are arranged on the two sides of the supporting frame one side of the supporting frame is connected with a torsion bar through a ball bearing the torsion bar is arranged in the diagonal direction the torsion bar is connected with a steering system and the steering system controls the rotating direction of the front wheels And the rear wheel and the front wheel rotate in opposite directions through the torsion bar so that safe turning driving is realized at a relatively high vehicle speed and a relatively high turning angle and the stability of driving and turning is improved
