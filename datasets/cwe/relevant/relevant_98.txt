 JPA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To surely recognize whether a seal ring is correctly mounted or not by the feeling of hand in periodically replacing the seal ring in a bearing device for a wheelSOLUTION A seal ring  is mounted on an annular step portion  formed at an inner peripheral side of a large end face  of an inner ring and the annular step portion  is formed by connecting a fitting face  and a relief portion  of a diameter larger than the fitting face  In the seal ring  an annular seal member  composed of an elastic body and a substantially annular flexible member  having elasticity in a radial direction are integrally formed and an outer diameter dimension of the flexible member  is larger than an inner diameter dimension of the fitting face  and smaller than an inner diameter dimension of the relief portion  When the seal ring is assembled in an axle tube an outer periphery of the flexible member  is accommodated in the relief portion SELECTED DRAWING Figure
