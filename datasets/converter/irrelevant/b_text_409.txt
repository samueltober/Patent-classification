 USB An apparatus comprises a plurality of voltage sources one or more processors embedded with the plurality of voltage sources and memory storing processor executable instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the apparatus to modify duty cycles of the voltage sources and to modify timing for each phase of a multiphase cycle In some cases the apparatus transfers for each phase of the multiphase cycle power from a different source of a plurality of sources to a load determines for each phase of the multiphase cycle an input voltage associated with the transferred power an output voltage associated with the transferred power and current from the source associated with the transferred power determines a duty cycle associated with the source modifies duty cycles of the voltage sources and modifies timing for each phase of the multiphase cycle
