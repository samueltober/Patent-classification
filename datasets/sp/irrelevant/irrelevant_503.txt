 CNU According to the balance shaft assembly the middle of a communicating shaft is in an inverted V shape or a U shape bearing hubs are arranged at the two ends of the inverted V shape or the U shape ofthe communicating shaft in an extending mode a support is of an integrated design and is arranged at the connecting position of the communicating shaft and the bearing hubs and thrust rod installation parts are arranged below the bearing hubs According to the balance shaft assembly the trafficability and the reliability are improved the thrust rod mounting part in the balance shaft assemblyis adjusted to the bearing hub from the bracket so that the thrust rod directly acts on the thrust rod the thrust rod mounting part is added to the lower part of the adjusted bearing hub and the strength of the bottom of the bearing hub is effectively improved After adjustment the height of the balanced suspension assembly is reduced from original  mm to  mm the ground clearance of thebalanced suspension assembly is increased by  mm and therefore trafficability is greatly improved After adjustment the weight of the balance suspension bracket is reduced the weight of the bearing hub is increased but the overall comprehensive weight is reduced the weight of the balance shaft assembly is reduced by  Kg after adjustment and the effective light weight of the balance shaft assembly reaches
