 CNU The utility model relates to the technical field of robots in particular to an AGV intelligent mobile chassis and aims to solve the problems that the gravity center of a robot is too high the chassis is not stable the internal arrangement of many robot chassis is unreasonable the size is increased the operation is inconvenient and the operation is inconvenient when the lower layer is a walking chassis due to the fact that more mobile robot mounting equipment exists at present In order to solve the problems that a disc body is provided with four driven wheels a driving wheel is directly connected with a motor in the middle of the disc body a motor support is fixed with a swing arm the swing arm is fixed on a bearing seat and the bearing seat is fixed on the upper side of the disc body the design structure is simple the assembly is convenient and the driving module and the driven wheels are all fixed on the upper side of the chassis And the laser radar the ultrasonic sensor and the power supply control panel are compactly arranged so that the installation is more reasonable the disassembly the assembly and the maintenance are convenient and particularly the inspection robot can walk more stably due to the design of the lowcenterofgravity mobile chassis with more mounted equipment and larger mass
