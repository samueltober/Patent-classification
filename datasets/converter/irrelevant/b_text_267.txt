 CNB The invention discloses a CLCL resonant type DCDirect CurrentDC converter of fundamental frequencyfrequency doubling dual operating modalities belongs to the technical field of DCDC conversionand solves the problem that an existing CLCL halfbridge highorder resonant type DCDC converter has a narrow input voltage range The converter is characterized in that a direct current voltage conversion unit is connected with a direct current power supply for generating a first squarewave voltage signal when the converter works under a fundamental frequency modality and for generating a second squarewave voltage signal when the converter works under a frequency doubling modality the frequencies of two squarewave voltage signals are equal duty ratios are both  the amplitude of thesecond squarewave voltage signal is half of the first squarewave voltage signal the voltage input side and the voltage output side of a CLCL resonant unit are independently in cascade connection with the voltage output side of the direct current voltage conversion unit and a transformer primary winding and an alternating current voltage signal output by the transformer primary winding is rectified through a rectification unit and filtered through a filtering unit in sequence to be loaded to two ends of a load
