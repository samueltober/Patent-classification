 CNA The invention discloses a distributed driving independent suspension wheelside motor assembly which is mainly used for manufacturing pure electric vehicles An axle assembly is of a disconnected structure and the suspensions on the left side and the right side are connected with a frame through rubber spherical hinge structures to achieve independence of movement of a left wheel end and a rightwheel end A motor is directly connected with a steering knuckle and fixedly arranged on the inner side of the steering knuckle and power is output through a rotor of the motor to directly drive thewheel end half shaft to rotate According to the invention a traditional transmission shaft gearbox structure is cancelled motors are integrated on wheel sides the left wheel motor and the right wheel motor are symmetrically arranged and meanwhile a doublewishbone independent suspension is combined to form a distributed driving independent suspension wheelside motor assembly The axle assembly is compact in structural arrangement a system is simplified a transmission chain is shortened transmission efficiency is improved Due to the fact that the suspension is of a doublewishbone independent suspension structure the unsprung mass can be greatly reduced the purpose of light weight is achieved the requirement for a low bottom plate can be met and meanwhile the control stability and smoothness of a vehicle are improved
