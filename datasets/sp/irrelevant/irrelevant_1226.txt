 CNU An articulated chassis comprises a frame body a connecting piece at least two articulated pieces a wheel set and a ratchet wheel power assisting device Wherein the connecting piece is connected with the front frame and the rear frame the sliding rod penetrates through the linear bearing assembly to be fixedly connected with the sliding rod fixing base the spring is arranged on the sliding rod in a sleeving mode and the sliding rod fixing base is fixedly connected with the rear frame The hinge frame is hinged to a hinge point of the front frame in the wheel set the rear wheel is installed on the rear frame and the middle wheel and the front wheel are installed at the two ends of the hinge frame respectively In the ratchet wheel power assisting device a ratchet wheel is pivotedto a first gear and installed on a front frame one end of a ratchet wheel push rod is fixed to a sliding rod the other end is meshed with the ratchet wheel a second gear is concentric with a hingepoint and connected to a hinge frame through a second rotating shaft and the first gear is meshed with the second gear When the articulated chassis moves the rear wheels drive the rear frame to compress the spring to push the sliding rod the ratchet wheel push rod drives the ratchet wheel to rotate and drives the first gear and the second gear to enable the articulated frame to generate assistance to lift the front wheel and therefore the articulated chassis can cross obstacles
