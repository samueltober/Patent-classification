 WOA A mechanical active suspension system for a vehicle A fixed end of a spring in a suspension is connected to a vehicle body by means of a screwnut mechanism   or a worm gearworm mechanism   An ECU  controls a servo motor  to drive the nut  or the worm  to rotate so that the screw  and the worm gear  drive a swing arm connected thereto to generate lifting and lowering motions with respect to the vehicle body thereby adjusting the height of a vehicle chassis A multistage spring is used in the suspension to achieve the soft and hard adjustment of the suspension The ECU controls the operation of each motor in real time according to data fed back by each sensor The lifting and lowering of each independent suspension are adjusted so as to counteract the actions of the vehicle body of turning and tilting brake nodding and starting and raising the head In an unequallength double wishbone suspension one wishbone  is connected to the vehicle body by means of an eccentric shaft  and the ECU  controls a servo motor  to drive a worm  or a worm gear  to drive the eccentric shaft  to rotate thereby adjusting the inclination angle between the wheel and the ground The present mechanical active suspension system for a vehicle solves the problems of the high price and subsequent excessive maintenance costs of current active suspensions and further improves the performance thereof
