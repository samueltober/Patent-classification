 CNA The invention relates to a novel electric wheel system combining a semiactive suspension and an electric wheel The novel electric wheel system comprises the wheel a hub motor a brake an axle anMR damper the semiactive suspension and the like The hub motor adopts a doublerotor inner stator structure a left rotor and a right rotor are symmetrically arranged relative to a stator and uniform gaps are formed on two sides of the stator The working cavity of the MR damper is filled with magnetorheological fluid the piston does reciprocating rectilinear motion after a wire wound on thepiston is powered on the flowing characteristic of the magnetorheological fluid changes under the action of a magnetic field generated by exciting current the pressure difference between the two ends of the damping channel changes accordingly and therefore the damping force of the damper can be changed in real time
