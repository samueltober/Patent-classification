The invention provides a converter control method and system The method comprises the following steps acquiring a converter state quantity instantaneous parameter and a preset reference parameter acquiring a reference threephase inductance current amplitude and a phase angle through power loop control taking the converter as a controllable voltage source taking the converter threephase alternating current voltage as a controlled voltage source and acquiring a reference threephase alternating current voltage through current loop control and modulating the reference threephase alternating current voltage through a modulation technology to generate a switching tube trigger signal of the converter With application of the preset reference active power and the preset reference reactive power the current amplitude and the phase angle of the reference threephase inductor are dynamically adjusted so that the controllability of the active power and the reactive power of the converter is realized and the converter serves as a controllable voltage source and threephase alternating voltage outputted by the converter is controlled respectively and thus alternating current side harmonic current and power grid harmonic oscillation of the converter can be reduced
