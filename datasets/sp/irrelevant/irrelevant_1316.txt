 CNA The invention relates to an interconnected air suspension cooperative control system and method based on MPC in the field of semiactive suspension system control of vehicles The cooperative controlsystem is composed of a sensor module an expansion observer module an MPC controller a damping coefficient controller an interconnection state controller a vehicle body height controller a damping coefficient executing mechanism an interconnection state executing mechanism and a vehicle body height executing mechanism The MPC controller starts from the top layer the influence of a dampingcoefficient an interconnection state and a vehicle body height on the performance is always attributed to the suspension force provided by respective actuating mechanisms optimization of suspensionperformance indexes is taken as an optimization target The optimal suspension force is generated by controlling corresponding actuating mechanisms through a damping coefficient controller an interconnection state controller and a vehicle body height controller in sequence the optimal suspension force of the system is solved through the MPC controller then the optimal suspension force is distributed through the damping coefficient the interconnection state and the vehicle body height executing mechanism in sequence the control precision is improved and the system and method are suitablefor control under any working condition
