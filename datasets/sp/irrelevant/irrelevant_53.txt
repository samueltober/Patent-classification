 GBB A front suspension system for an electric wheelchair is provided The suspension system includes a front pivot shaft  a front wheel retainer  an elasticity resistance member  and a front shock absorber  The front shock absorber  is disposed on a horizontal first section  of the front wheel retainer  so as to improve climbing capability of the wheelchair The elasticity resistance member  is disposed between the frame  and the front wheel retainer  and has two ends connected to the front wheel retainer  and an abutting member  of the frame  respectively When the front wheels  encounter a bumpy road and make the front wheel retainer  pivot the elasticity resistance member  will be compressed to produce a reaction force toward the front wheel retainer  and the abutting member  of the frame  respectively so that the front wheel retainer  is pressed down to keep pressing against the flat bearing surface G and the frame  is also pressed downward to prevent tipping backward
