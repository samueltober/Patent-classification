 CNA     Provide a dualreuse energy storage power supply system based on abandoned coal mine resources including abandoned coal mines mine water storage power supply system and mine compressed air energy storage power supply system mine water storage energy storage The power supply system extracts the accumulated water in the abandoned coal mine for highlevel storage and converts the highlevel water level into electrical energy the compressed air energy storage power supply system for the mine compresses the air to high pressure and stores it in the abandoned coal mine The compressed air The energy storage power supply system converts air pressure energy into electrical energy during the release of compressed air in abandoned coal mines This scheme develops the value of the use of abandoned mines realizes pumped storage energy storage and compressed air energy storage regulates the energy storage of power supply improves the flexibility and safety of the power grid and turns abandoned mines into valuable resources realizing changes Waste is treasure
