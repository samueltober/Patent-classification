 DEA     Leaf spring suspension with a spring leaf carrier  and an elongated spring leaf  made of fiberreinforced plastic which has two spring leaf ends   at a distance from one another in the direction of its longitudinal extension of which a first spring leaf end  is rotatably mounted on the spring leaf carrier  about a first axis of rotation  and a second spring leaf end  is rotatable on a spring shackle about a second axis of rotation  running parallel to the first axis of rotation   is mounted which is mounted on the spring leaf carrier  so as to be rotatable at a distance from the second spring leaf end  about a third axis of rotation  running parallel to the second rotation axis  wherein the distance between the two spring leaf ends   can be changed by an elastic deformation of the spring leaf  and wherein the third axis of rotation  is positioned between the first and the second axis of rotation   such that in an elastic deformation state of the spring leaf  in which the spring leaf ends   are at the greatest possible distance from one another between a through the first and the second axis of rotation   defined spring leaf plane  and a shackle plane  defined by the second and third axes of rotation   is less than
