 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a bearing device for a wheel which can eliminate an anxiety that the sealing performance of a seal member is lowered can suppress the deterioration of the roundness of an outside rolling face and also can prevent the lowering of a bearing life by preventing the damage of rolling bodies and the outside rolling faceSOLUTION In a bearing device  for a wheel a substantiallydisc circular drain conduit g with a rotating axis of an inner member  as a center is formed at an external periphery of an outer side of an outer member  a substantiallydisc circular heavy thickness part h with a rotating axis L of the inner member  as a center is formed at an external periphery of an outer side rather than the drain conduit g of the outer member  the heavy thickness part h has a region being an oblique side j at a cross section in an axial direction and the oblique side j is inclined so as to descend to an inner side from the outer sideSELECTED DRAWING Figure
