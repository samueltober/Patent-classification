The present disclosure relates to a device method and computer program for reducing signal distortion in mobile communication Specifically it relates to a transmitter system including multiple signal paths Each signal path is associated with the input transmission signal Each signal path includes the analog portion of the signal path Each signal path includes a dualinput digital predistortion DI DPD module The DI DPD is configured to provide a predistorted input transmission signal to the analog part in response to the received crosstalk and mismatch CTM signal and the input transmission signal The transmitter system also includes one or more CTM modules configured to receive one or more input transmission signals The CTM module includes generating a CTM signal separately for each DI DPD module where the CTM signal represents CTM distortion caused by one or more output transmission signals of each analog part
