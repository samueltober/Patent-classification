 JPB PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To prevent a slinger fitted in a hub shaft from plastically deforming and to prevent the slinger from moving from a predetermined position in the hub shaft in a wheel bearing deviceSOLUTION A wheel bearing device includes a hub shaft an outer ring a plurality of rolling elements a cage an annular seal member mounted on the outer ring and an annular slinger  which is mounted on the hub shaft and with which the seal member comes into sliding contact The slinger  includes a cylindrical part  fitted in the hub shaft in a tightfitting manner and an annular part  extending radially outside from a vehicle outer side of the cylindrical part  At the slinger  a plurality of slits  opening on the vehicle inner side of the cylindrical part  are formed The slit  has a shape which includes a pair of side surfaces which oppose with each other in the circumferential direction and in which an interval increases toward the vehicle outer side from the vehicle inner side a deep surface on the vehicle outer side and a concave round surface for connecting each of the pair of the side surfaces and the deep surfaceSELECTED DRAWING Figure
