 CNB The invention relates to a modulation method for reducing internal insulation stress of a cascaded converter which is characterized by comprising the steps of  modulating the cascaded converter byadopting a carrier phase shift pulse width modulation method to obtain an output voltage and an initial phase shift angle of each stage of unit in the cascaded converter  optimizing the initial phase shift angle of each stage of unit in the cascaded converter to obtain the optimal phase shift angle of each stage of unit and  adjusting the carrier phase of each stage of unit in the cascaded converter according to the optimal phase shift angle of each stage of unit in the cascaded converter obtained in the step  so as to reduce a highfrequency harmonic component of the voltage to groundof an output port of each stage of unit On the basis of not changing the overall output of the cascaded converter the highfrequency harmonic component of the voltage to ground output by each unitcan be reduced so that the insulation stress is reduced and the insulation performance of the power electronic converter is improved Therefore the method can be widely applied to power electronicconverters
