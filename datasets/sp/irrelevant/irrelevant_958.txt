 CNU The utility model provides an antiroll bar and an automobile which relate to the technical field of vehicles and comprise a connecting rod component and adjusting rods respectively arranged at two end parts of the connecting rod component When the rigidity of the antiroll rod does not meet the actual driving requirement the end rotationally connected with the connecting rod assembly of theadjusting rod is rotated and the rotating direction is the axis direction of the adjusting rod The adjusting rods are arranged in the same radial section the radial lengths passing through the central axis are unequal therefore after rotating for a certain angle the motor rotates the radial length of the adjusting rod along the hanging and pulling direction can be changed in other words the rigidity in the pulling direction can be correspondingly changed when the antiroll rod rotates to a proper angle the adjusting rod has rigidity meeting the actual driving requirement in the pulling direction of suspension at the moment so that the purpose of adjusting the rigidity of the antiroll rod is achieved meanwhile the driving diversification requirement is also improved and thestability of a vehicle in the driving process is improved
