 USA Generalized circuit topology of voltage level multiplier modules VLMMs for use with multilevel inverters MLIs and power converter circuits comprising at least one VLMM and a MLI are described herein The VLMM is configured to receive a first output voltage from the MLI having a first number of voltage levels and to generate a second output voltage having a second number of voltage levels If the first number of voltage levels is M and the VLMM is Nfold voltage level multiplier then second number of voltage levels is MN Switching pattern generators for use with the VLMM and modulation methods for controlling switching elements of the VLMM are also described herein
