 CNU     The utility model discloses a novel omnidirectional wheel mobile shockabsorbing chassis which includes a chassis frame The top and bottom of the chassis frame are both equipped with a bottom plate The four corners of the chassis frame are equipped with main wheel frames A linear ball guide rail is fixed at the center of one side of the main wheel frame through a sliding rail frame and a linear ball guide slider is slidably connected to the linear ball guide rail One side of the linear ball guide slider is mounted on the main wheel frame The inner main wheel seat the top of the main wheel seat is installed with a main wheel set and the corresponding two sides of the main wheel carrier are installed with bearing frames The utility model has a novel structure and a clever concept It uses the guiding effect of the linear ball guide rail and the linear ball guide slider to assist the linear bearing and the shockabsorbing spring so that the shockabsorbing process is smoother the shockabsorbing effect is good and the assembly error Small will not cause the main wheel set to hang in the air and can improve the accuracy of the grating encoder data recording so that the robot positioning system will not fail
