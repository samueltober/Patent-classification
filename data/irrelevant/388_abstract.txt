This document discloses a device and method for a controllable network used in a multistage power conversion system to change the power transfer between stages By using the controllable network  within the first power converter stage  the intermediate power delivered to the subsequent or second power converter stage  can be changed so that the multistage power conversion The system  can respond to full load steps while providing improved light load power conversion efficiency The power estimation circuit  in the second power converter stage  can provide a control signal CCN to each of the controllable networks  the controllable network   in turn may provide network signals S S to control the intermediate power delivered to the second power converter stage
