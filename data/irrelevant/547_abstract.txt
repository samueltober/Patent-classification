OA       The power conversion system  consists of a selfexcited power converter  that converts power between the first AC system  and the DC system  and the primary side is connected to the first AC system Between the st transformer  whose secondary side is connected to a selfexcited power converter and the neutral point  and ground on the secondary side of the st transformer or the secondary of the st transformer It is equipped with an AC line  connecting the side and selfexcited power converters and a first impedance circuit  connected between the grounds The first impedance circuit includes one of the reactor  and the other transformer
