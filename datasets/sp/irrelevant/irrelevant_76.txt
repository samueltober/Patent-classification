 CNB The invention relates to an independent suspension mechanism for a motor vehicle rear wheel capable of erecting and bouncing and belongs to the field of independent suspension mechanisms for rear wheels of motor vehicles with two or more wheels The technical problem that when a motor vehicle rear wheel is in an independent suspension the wheel cannot erect and bounce for a long time and bouncing of the wheel can change the original erecting state is solved the bouncing amplitude of a vehicle can be increased conveniently by solving the problem the load of the vehicle is increased and the stability of driving is improved According to the technical scheme a triangular stabilizing frame is arranged the front end of the triangular stabilizing frame can be fixed on the vehicle body in an upanddown rotating mode the rear end of the triangular stabilizing frame extends to the two sides and can hang two rear flat forks erected with wheels damping devices are arranged on the rear flat fork corresponding to a vehicle body frame above the rear flat fork a bearing outer cover on the fixed vehicle body frame is sleeved with an equilateral shaft intersection extension shaft rod of the triangular stabilizing frame a bottom shaft central point extension shaft rod of the triangular stabilizing frame is provided with a bearing position the two bearing positions are on the same straight line and located in the same plane with the stabilizing frame and the damping devices are arranged on the two sides of the portion between the stabilizing frame and the vehicle body frame respectively
