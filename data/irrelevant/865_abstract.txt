The invention discloses a control method for increasing the operating power limit of a cascaded hybrid DC unipolar First the cascaded hybrid DC pole I is normally unlocked and started to a rated operating state and the LCC converter station of pole II is in a shutdown state Then unlock the MMC converter station of pole II and work in STATCOM mode and increase the reactive power through the MMC converter station of pole II to meet the reactive power demand of LCC DC after the power of pole I is increased The invention can meet the reactive power demand of LCC DC after the hybrid DC unipolar power is increased without adding an additional reactive power compensation device so that the hybrid DC unipolar system can operate normally and stably it can reduce the LCC DC conversion after the unipolar power is increased Phase failure risk simple control no need for additional equipment
