 JPA To provide a processing method of an outer ring flange part of a wheel bearing device which can grind a fastening face fastened with a bolt of the outer ring flange part so as to have surface roughness at which a regulated thrust force can be secured and can shorten a grind processing timeSOLUTION A fastening face  is latheturned so that a value which is obtained by calculating a friction coefficient  of the fastening face  from the following regression equation with a kurtosis Rku of a roughness curve of the fastening face  fastened with a bolt  of an outer ring flange part  of a wheel bearing device  arithmetic average roughness Ra and an average length RSm of a roughness curve element set as explanation variables reaches  or larger to  or smaller RkuRaRSmT Here T is the fastening torque of the bolt  and a value which is preset within a range of  Nm or larger and  Nm or smallerSELECTED DRAWING Figure
