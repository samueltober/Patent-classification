 USB A suspension actuator includes an upper mount a lower mount a first actuator mechanism and a second actuator mechanism The upper mount is connectable to a sprung mass of a vehicle The lower mount is connectable to an unsprung mass of the vehicle The first actuator mechanism forms a first load path between the upper mount and the lower mount The first actuator mechanism is one of an electromagnetic linear actuator mechanism or a ball screw actuator mechanism The second actuator mechanism forms a second load path in parallel with the first load path between the upper mount and the lower mount The second actuator mechanism is one of a mechanical linear actuator mechanism an air spring actuator mechanism or a hydraulic actuator mechanism
