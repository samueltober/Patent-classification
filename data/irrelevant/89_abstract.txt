The invention provides a multiport DCDC system MDS topology with stepless DC voltage regulation The MDS has multiple ports to be interconnected with an external DC system The ports are configured as a hybrid series converter An AC side is connected to a common AC bus in the MDS through an AC circuit breaker In the MDS transformers match DC lines with different voltage classes The hybrid series converter is formed by connecting in series a currentsource converter unit and a voltagesource converter unit The currentsource converter unit includes a LCC based on a diode or a thyristor The voltagesource converter unit has a modular multilevel structure Each bridge arm is formed by cascaded connection of submodules with no negative level output capabilities such as IGBT module HBSM and submodules with negative level output capabilities such as FBSM The MDS has a stepless DC voltage regulation or even reverse polarity capability achieves both DC fault ride through and rapid recovery capabilities helps to quickly reverse power flow Therefore the MDS topology helps to promote the application of the multiport DCDC converter in a DC power system
