A multilevel power converter and method are presented The converter provides a ground terminal an input terminal and an output terminal It also provides an inductor a first flying capacitor a second flying capacitor and a network of switches The network of switches is driven with a sequence of states including a first state and a second state In the first state one of the input terminal and the ground terminal is coupled to the output terminal via a first path containing the first flying capacitor and which bypasses the inductor while the remaining terminal among the input terminal and the ground terminal is coupled to the output terminal via a second path containing the second flying capacitor and the inductor
