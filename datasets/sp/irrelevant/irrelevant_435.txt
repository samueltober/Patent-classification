 CNB The invention discloses a car active suspension electromagnetic actuator antisaturation composite controller and a construction method thereof and belongs to the field of vehicle chassis control The construction method comprises the steps that a mutant load compensation controller a state feedback controller and a voltage decoupling controller are constructed correspondingly a controller parameter optimization module is adopted the global optimal controller gain of the state feedback controller is obtained through a grey wolf optimization algorithm the controller parameter optimizationmodule and the state feedback controller are in series connection and the state feedback controller the mutant load compensation controller and the voltage decoupling controller are in parallel connection and then are in series connection with a voltage limiting controller to constitute the antisaturation composite controller The response speed of an active suspension is increased under the premise of ensuring safety operation of a motor the maximum voltage supplied to the motor can be effectively improved the saturation phenomenon of the controller is inhibited and the adjusting timeis shortened
