A power stealing system having an electrical load a capacitive element having an input connected to the electrical load Some power from the electrical load may go through the capacitive element to an input of a rectifier A voltage regulator may have an input connected to an output of the rectifier to set and control a voltage level of the electrical power from the rectifier and provide an output of power stolen from the electrical load An amount of power flowing through the capacitive element may be less than one percent of power flowing through the electrical load
