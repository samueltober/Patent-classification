 CNA The invention discloses an optical transmission method and device based on power spectrum shaping Direct detection namely square demodulation of highspectrumefficiency optical signals is supported According to the invention a power spectrum shaping modulation method is adopted at a sending end and the modulation method realizes multilevel improved dualbinary coding and multilevel offsetdualbinary coding by biasing a MachZehnder optical modulator at a zero point namely Vpi and increasing level in combination with nonlinear precoding and can also realize residual sideband improved dualbinary coding in combination with an optical filter intersymbol interference of received signals is removed at a receiving end by adopting nonlinear equalization and meanwhile the difference of received levels can be fed back to a transmitter so that nonequidistant multilevel modulation is realized and the nonlinear equalization complexity is reduced According to the method signals needing coherent demodulation can be directly detected through proper nonlinear precoding and nonlinear equalization so that the hardware complexity is reduced
