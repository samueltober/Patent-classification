 JPA To provide a structure that can properly and easily secure moldability of an outer shape of a rotary member in forge processing and that can sufficiently secure axial length of a screw holeSOLUTION A rotary flange  includes a plurality of thickwalled parts  that are each extended outward in a radial direction from a plurality of circumferential locations of an outer peripheral surface of a body part  at least one middlethickness part  which is extended outward in the radial direction from a part circumferentially deviating from a part connected to a base end of a thickwalled part  of an outer peripheral surface of the body part  and a thinwalled part  that exists to be laid between the thickwalled parts  andor between the thickwalled part  and the middlethickness part  adjacent to each other in the circumferential directionSELECTED DRAWING Figure
