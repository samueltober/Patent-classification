 CNU     The utility model relates to the technical field of robots in particular to a chassis and a robot having the same A chassis includes a base a swing mechanism the first end is rotatably connected with the base and the second end is rotatably connected with a driving wheel an elastic member is arranged perpendicular to the base one end is connected with the second end of the swing mechanism and the other end is connected There is a pressure plate the pressure plate is provided with a long waist hole and the other end of the elastic member is set in the long waist hole When the swing mechanism swings the second end of the swing mechanism exerts a force close to or away from the pressure plate on the elastic member to make the elastic The piece compresses or stretches and slides along the long waist hole The utility model provides a chassis while ensuring that the elastic member will not be twisted during compression and extension resulting in a reduction in service life when the driving wheel receives an external force there is no need to use a top block to convert the swing of the swing mechanism  Utilize the swing mechanism to directly compress or stretch the elastic element and make full use of the elasticity of the elastic element to achieve a better shock absorption effect
