 CNB A bearing device for a wheel in which the sealing ability and durability of a seal are enhanced to extend the life of a bearing The bearing device for a wheel has the seal  mounted to an opening of an annular space formed between an outer member  and a hub ring  An inner base b of a wheel mounting flange  has a circular arc crosssectional shape and the seal  makes sliding contact with the base b A step  is formed between an inner side surface d and the base b of the wheel mounting flange  and a corner of the step  is formed in a combined circular arc surface having curvature radii Ra Rb An annular recess  is formed in the inner periphery at the outer end of the outer member  A substantially Lshaped labyrinth seal  is formed soas to face the corner of the step with a small gap therebetween Because of the construction above stress concentration in the hub ring  is relaxed and the seal  is prevented from being directly exposed to muddy water coming from the outside and as a result the sealing ability and durability of the seal  are enhanced
