 USB This disclosure provides a PSRPWM technique for high power active frontend inverters to damp a specific interharmonic that may cause relative subsynchronous resonance in power system Due to the strong interaction between wind power converters photovoltaic converters FACTS devices and HVDC transmission lowfrequency oscillations occur from a few Hz to dozens of Hz or even highfrequency oscillations ranging from about  Hz Meanwhile lowfrequency oscillations ranging from  Hz to  Hz occur in the power supply systems of many electric locomotives Even in the case of largescale train outage lowfrequency oscillation will lead to abnormal locomotive dispatching system in addition the power grid voltage disturbance and flicker caused by a large number of highpower are furnaces and other nonlinear loads in the industrial field with a passband interharmonic frequency ranging from  Hz Hz and so on are detected
