 CNU The utility model belongs to the field of robots relates to a movable chassis of a meal delivery robot and aims to solve the problems that most existing movable chassis of the robot is not providedwith a suspension structure and is poor in obstacle crossing and overcutting capacity most movable chassis of the robot with the suspension structure in related technologies adopts a tension springsuspension structure and the gravity center of the chassis is high Under the condition that the bearing capacity of the restaurant meal delivery robot is allowed the problem that walking is unstable due to the fact that the gravity center of a chassis is too high is solved The movable ground plate comprises a plate body two driving wheels two suspension mechanisms and two groups of driven wheels the meal delivery robot is convenient to mount the flat shaft of the hub motor can swing up and down along with the swing arm a good damping effect is achieved on the movable chassis the design of the trundles and the damping structure effectively reduces the gravity center of the movable chassis and the meal delivery robot is more stable in the meal delivery process
