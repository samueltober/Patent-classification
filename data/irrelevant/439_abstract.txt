A power converter includes an input node on an input side of the power converter an output node on an output side of the power converter a switch coupled to the input node and having a switch control node an inductor coupled to the switch and to the output node and a feedback compensation and control circuit between the output node and the switch control node The feedback compensation and control circuit includes two or more programmable resistors to adjust one or more gains of i a proportionalintegralderivative portion and ii a bandpass filter portion of the feedback compensation and control circuit The feedback compensation and control circuit receives an output voltage from the output node and generates a compensated feedback signal based on the output voltage from the output node and the one or more gains the switch control node being controlled based on the compensated feedback signal
