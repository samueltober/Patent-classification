The measuring system comprises a vibrationtype measuring sensor a sensor housing  for the measuring sensor a magneticfield detector  for sensing a magnetic field HH established inside the measuring system and measuringsystem electronics ME which are electrically coupled both to an oscillation exciter and to oscillationsensing devices of the measuring sensor the measuring sensor being positioned inside the sensor housing  and the magneticfield detector being positioned outside the sensor housing The measuringsystem electronics ME are designed to feed electrical power into the oscillation exciter by means of an electrical driver signal e in such a way that a vibration element of the measuring transducer performs forced mechanical oscillations at a specified oscillation frequency Furthermore the magneticfield detector is designed to convert changes in the magnetic field into a magneticfield signal  which has an amplitude U dependent on a magnetic flux  through the magneticfield detector andor on an area density B of said magnetic flux  The measuringsystem electronics are designed to determine on the basis of oscillation measurement signals s s of the measuring sensor the massflowrate measurement values representing the mass flow rate and to at least qualitatively determine on the basis of the magneticfield signal whether an external magnetic field H is established inside the measuring sensor
