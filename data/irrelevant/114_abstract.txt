In certain aspects methods and systems for controlling power transfer at a wireless power receiver are disclosed In certain aspects a method includes determining a duty cycle of a DCDC converter of the wireless power receiver The method further includes determining a duty cycle limit for an AC switching controller based on the determined duty cycle The method further includes determining an operational duty cycle for the AC switching controller The method further includes comparing the operational duty cycle to the duty cycle limit The method further includes adjusting at least one of a desired voltage and current input to the DCDC converter when the operational duty cycle is greater than the duty cycle limit
