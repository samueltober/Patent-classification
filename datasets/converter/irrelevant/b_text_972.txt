 CNA     The invention relates to a progressive layered voltage equalization method in a photovoltaic DC boost collection system based on modular cascade and belongs to the technical field of circuits On the basis of independent control between modules a postlevel progressive topology suitable for module voltage equalization is proposed to solve the problem that the modules cannot be boosted normally due to uneven illumination in the photovoltaic series collection unit Each photovoltaic array in the collection system adjusts the voltage division of the module through the subsequent voltage equalization module thereby expanding the output voltage adjustment range of the converter under uneven illumination and improving its adaptability to power disturbances under uneven illumination A simulation model of four modules cascaded is built through Simulink and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the topology
