 CNB The invention relates to an automobile transverse plate spring suspension system with the function of rigidity continuous adjusting The automobile transverse plate spring suspension system comprisesa pair of upper supports a pair of lower supports and a transverse plate spring A rigidity continuous adjusting mechanism is arranged on the transverse plate spring and comprises a pair of variabledamping shock absorbers a drive motor a transmission mechanism and a pair of pulley mechanisms The transmission mechanism comprises a bidirectional lead screw and a pair of gears The rotating directions of lead screw threads on the two sides of the bidirectional lead screw are opposite Each pulley mechanism comprises an upper guide pulley a lower guide pulley and a pulley seat The upper guide pulleys and the lower guide pulleys form an upanddown clamping state on an upper support cross beam and the transverse plate spring During work the drive motor drives the pair of pulley mechanisms through the transmission mechanism to do constantspeed samedirection or opposite linear movement the bending deformation degree of the transverse plate spring is adjusted and therefore the rigidity of the transverse plate spring is adjusted The rigidity continuous adjusting mechanism adopts common transmission parts the control manner is simple and efficient the structure is compact the size is small the cost is low and operation is easy to achieve
