The invention discloses a highvoltage broadband voltage detection circuit applied to a power electronic transformer which comprises an impedance matching circuit a differential attenuation circuitan active filtering and phase margin compensation circuit and a differential output circuitwherein the impedance matching circuit is used for carrying out impedance matching on an input voltage sothat the impedance proportion of an input signal is kept constant in a relatively wide frequency range the differential attenuation circuit is used for carrying out proportional attenuation on the input highvoltage signal and is matched with the precedingstage impedance matching circuit so that the voltage division proportion is constant in a relatively wide frequency range the active filtering and phase margin compensation circuit is used for limiting the bandwidth of the input signal and increasing the phase margin of the circuit under the limitation of the bandwidth and the differential output circuit is used for carrying out differential output on the conditioning signal and sending the signal to a poststage ADC for processing Highfrequency and highvoltage signals input by the transformer are detected the frequency response is good the measurement voltage is high meanwhile the circuit structure is simple and the cost is low
