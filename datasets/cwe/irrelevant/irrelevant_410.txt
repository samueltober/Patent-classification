 CNA The invention relates to a sealing assembly The sealing assembly is used for sealing a first component and a second component which can rotate relatively The sealing assembly is annular overall andcomprises a framework and a sealing part and the sealing part comprises a first main sealing lip extending from the radial inner side end of the framework to the axial inner side and the radial innerside The sealing assembly further comprises a second main sealing lip and a dustproof part the first main sealing lip and the second main sealing lip are arranged at an interval in the radial direction and the dustproof part comprises a first edge a second edge and a third edge The first edge and the second edge approximately extend in the axial direction of the sealing assembly and the third edge approximately extends in the axial direction The first edge is used for fixedly mounting the dustproof part on the first component the first main sealing lip is constructed to form contact type sealing with the first component or the first edge the second main sealing lip is constructed to form contact type sealing with the third edge and therefore the portions located between the first main sealing lip and the second main sealing lip of the dustproof part the first main sealing lip the second main sealing lip the framework andor the sealing part define a sealing cavity in asurrounding manner
