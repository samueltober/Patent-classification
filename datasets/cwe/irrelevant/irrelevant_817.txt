 CNU     The utility model discloses a heatresistant hub for highspeed vehicles which comprises a hub shell a bearing a shockabsorbing ring a shaft center a tower base a first radiating ring and a second radiating ring The shaft is sleeved There is a first radiating ring the first radiating ring is arranged at both ends of the shaft the outer side of the first radiating ring is sleeved with a bearing the outer side of the bearing is sleeved with a second radiating ring and the outer side of the second radiating ring is sleeved with a shockabsorbing ring to reduce The outer side of the vibrating ring is sleeved with a hub shell one end of the hub shell is provided with a tower base it also includes a dust ring on the one hand the stability and heat dissipation of the hub are improved through the shock absorption structure and the heat dissipation structure which solves the increase in stress and The problem of heat accumulation ensures the stability of the bearing reduces deformation and improves the working quality of the hub On the other hand a dustproof structure is added to effectively prevent dust from entering the hub avoiding the blockage of the hub and affecting heat dissipation and also solves the problem of lubrication The problem of oil condensation has strong practicability and long service life
