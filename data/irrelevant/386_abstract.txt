The invention belongs to the field studying the devices for soil and water conservation The invention involves a topographymeter host based on integrative mainboards which dynamically observe the landform in realtime and threedimensions The linear laser sources are accurately positioned with Ohmshaped clamps so as to emit parallel and equidistant laserplanes projecting onto a terrain in an experiment The positions of the lasersources on the mainboards are fixed with the Ohmshaped clamps The clamps do not only realize the convenient adjustment of the emission angle and spacing distance of the adjacent lasersources but also ensure a high accuracy of the positions and angles of the lasersources even if the topographymeter host is moved Several multisegmented cases are freely spliced to observe the landforms with different heights in realtime The invention is a novel topographymeter host which conveniently and accurately fixes the spacing distances and emission angles of the lasersources and the invention also satisfies the requirement in observing the landforms with different heights
