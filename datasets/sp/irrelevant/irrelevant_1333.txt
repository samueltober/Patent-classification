 USB An active suspension system for a vehicle having a wheel that is subject to an external force includes an actuator having an output structure that is connected to the wheel an energy storage device having a compressible chamber a valve assembly that is operable to control flow of a working fluid between the actuator and the energy storage device and a controller that determines whether to permit or resist motion of the output structure in response to the external force The controller permits motion of the output structure by allowing fluid to flow from the actuator to the energy storage device using the valve assembly thereby compressing the compressible chamber The controller resists motion of the output structure by allowing fluid to flow from the energy storage device to the actuator using the valve assembly thereby expanding the compressible chamber
