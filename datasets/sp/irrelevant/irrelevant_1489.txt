 CNA The invention relates to a movable target vehicle The movable target vehicle comprises a vehicle frame chassis and a flat shell covering the vehicle frame chassis the upper surface of the flat shellis provided with an obstacle mounting structure used for mounting an obstacle the movable target vehicle further comprises a steering mechanism steering wheels and plate springs which are located in the flat shell and the steering mechanism is connected with the vehicle frame chassis The steering mechanism is used for driving the steering wheels to rotate the plate springs extend in the leftright direction of the movable target vehicle and are connected with the vehicle frame chassis and the steering wheels are rotatably connected to the two ends of the plate springs and are connectedto the steering mechanism in an updown moving manner By means of the technical scheme the steering mechanism drives the steering wheels to deflect to achieve steering of a bearing vehicle the steering precision is higher the bearing vehicle can run according to a preset track the plate springs deform in the vertical direction to buffer impact force transmitted to the vehicle frame chassis from an uneven road surface and vibration caused by the impact force can be attenuated
