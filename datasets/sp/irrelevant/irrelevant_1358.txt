 CNA The invention discloses a magnetic suspension spring and eddy current damper coupled vehicle semiactive suspension for a new energy vehicle The magnetic suspension spring and eddy current damper coupled vehicle semiactive suspension comprises an eddy current damping generation structure a magnetic suspension spring structure and magnetorheological fluid And the weight of the vehicle body is supported by attraction force between the movable permanent magnet and the coil permanent magnet fixed on the lower working cylinder The suspension can control currents in the coil permanent magnet and the magnet exciting coil according to realtime feedback of the acceleration sensor installed in the piston the magnitude of acting force between the coil permanent magnet and the movable permanentmagnet and the viscosity characteristic of magnetorheological fluid are changed and therefore the rigidity and damping of the suspension can be adjusted When an automobile runs on a road surface with a severe road environment induced current generated in the coil permanent magnet can be recycled through an outerend circuit The problem that the rigidity and damping of the suspension are difficult to control is solved meanwhile graded adjustment of damping is achieved through the oneway valves the running smoothness of a vehicle is improved part of vibration energy can be recycled and good practical value is achieved
