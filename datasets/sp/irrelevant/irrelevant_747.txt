 CNU The independent suspension structure of the Mecanum wheel omnidirectional mobile robot comprises a suspension bottom plate and a motor speed reducer an Lshaped support a coupler an output shafta bearing seat for an axle and a damping device are arranged on the suspension bottom plate in a matched mode The motor speed reducer is connected with one end of the output shaft through a couplerthe suspension structure further comprises a torsional spring a torsional spring shaft an Lshaped connecting piece and a bearing seat for the torsional spring shaft a bearing for the torsional spring shaft is installed in the bearing seat for the torsional spring shaft and the axis of the bearing for the torsional spring shaft is parallel to the axis of the bearing for the axle One end of the torsion spring shaft is fixed on a vehicle body through the Lshaped connecting piece the other end of the torsion spring shaft is inserted into an inner ring of the bearing for the torsion springshaft the torsion spring shaft is sleeved with the torsion spring one end of the torsion spring is fixed on the Lshaped connecting piece and the other end of the torsion spring is fixed on the suspension bottom plate Double shock absorption is carried out through the spring damping shock absorber and the torsion spring the shock absorption effect is better and the robot moves more stably
