The invention mainly relates to an apparatus and a method for realizing data transmission The apparatus comprises a first device with a first processor and a second device with a second processor Apower line for transmitting power is connected between the second device and the first device An inductor closer to the first device than the second device is arranged on the power line and a first switch is arranged between a DC voltage source and a certain terminal of the inductor The manner that the first processor sends a carrier signal to the power line is mainly that driving the first switch to switch at high frequency between turning on and turning off so as to inject a high frequency pulse sequence regarded as a carrier signal carrying data information on the power line
