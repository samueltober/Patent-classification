 CNB The invention discloses a multichannel bandwidth and gain adjustable signal processing system and method and belongs to the technical field of electronics The system comprises a lowpass module which is used for the lowpass filtering of a microwave voltage signal a control module which performs channel gating on a first analog switch chip signal according to an upper computer signal and a or  signal transmitted by a voltage comparator and selects different toground resistances of an adjustable gain amplifier the adjustable gain amplifier which amplifies the microwave voltage signal after gain and bandwidth selection and transmits an output voltage signal to the voltage comparator and the voltage comparator which is used for judging whether the output voltage signal reachesa reference level or not outputting the  signal to the control module if the output voltage signal reaches the reference level and outputting the  signal if the output voltage signal does notreach the reference level According to the present invention the gain and the bandwidth are independently adjusted the dynamic range of a microwave receiver is wider and the signal stability is not influenced
