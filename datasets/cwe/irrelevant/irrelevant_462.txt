 KRA The present invention relates to an assembly device improving the stability of driving through a reduction in a hub bearing noise capable of preventing the generation of noise by enabling a hub bearing to obtain a sufficient support force through a fixing bolt which is relatively cheap and preventing an increase in the fatigue of a driver caused by noise through the provision of a silent driving environment by preventing the generation of noise caused by a shortage of a support force for a hub bearing as well as inducing safe driving by preventing a driver from being distracted The assembly device includes a steering knuckle having a taphole formed on a side and connected with steering a hub mounted inside the steering knuckle and combined as an axial shaft is inserted through the center a hub bearing for connecting the steering knuckle with the hub a fixing bolt for preventing the separation of the hub bearing by being inserted through the taphole of the steering knuckle and combined and a wheel disc fixed to an outer circumference surface of the hub through a hub bolt
