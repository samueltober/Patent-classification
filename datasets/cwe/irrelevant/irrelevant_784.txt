 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To realize a structure capable of preventing a rotating body for braking from being inadvertently dropped from a pilot portion of a rotating wheel and reducing a manufacturing cost even when a hub bolt is removed    A hub  has a concave groove  in an axially intermediate portion of a smalldiameter fitting surface portion  of a pilot portion  The concave groove  has a chamfered dimension of the outer chamfered portion  of the braking rotating body  at the connection portion between the radial inner end portion of the groove side circular ring surface portion  and the axially outer end portion of the groove side bottom surface portion  Radius of curvature R smaller than CAxial distance L between the grooveside annular surface portion  and the grooveside bottom surface portion  on the inner end in the axial directionh The axial distance L between the axially outer surface of the braking rotating body  and the axially inner end of the inner peripheral surfacebIs longer than
