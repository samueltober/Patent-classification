 JPA To provide a wheel bearing device in which deterioration in roundness of an outer raceway surface along elastic deformation of a flange mounted on a vehicle due to bolt fastening force is suppressed so as to prevent a reduction in bearing lifeSOLUTION There is provided a wheel bearing device  comprising an outer ring  having a flange e to be attached onto a vehicle body on its outer circumference an inner member comprising a hub ring  and at least one inner ring  pressfitted into the hub ring  and multiple ball lines  and  rotatably accommodated between track surfaces of both of the outer ring  and the inner member The flange e to be attached onto a vehicle body has a pitch circle P which is centered on the center axis of the outer ring  and provided with at least four bolt holes g Four bolt holes g among the bolt holes g which are adjacent one another on the pitch circle P with interposed a reference line B orthogonal to the center axis are of phase angles    and  for the bolt holes g within a predetermined range The four bolt holes are arranged in a manner where a straight line orthogonal to the center axis and the reference line B is a symmetry axis SSELECTED DRAWING Figure
