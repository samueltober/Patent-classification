In the present uninterruptible power supply apparatus U in a power failure of a commercial AC power supply  a switch  is turned off to electrically cut off the commercial AC power supply  from an AC input filter  and when DC voltage EEpEn that is the difference between terminaltoterminal voltages Ep En of first and second capacitors C C exceeds a threshold voltage ETH first and second IGBT devices Q Q or third and fourth IGBT devices Q Q included in the converter  are turned on and off to reduce DC voltage E
