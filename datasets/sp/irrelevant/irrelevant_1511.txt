 CNA The invention discloses an auxiliary spring device adopting a torsion bar as an elastic element The device comprises symmetrically arranged frames a rear axle arranged at the lower parts of the frames and a torsion bar connected with the upper parts of the frames at two sides a main spring is arranged at one sides of the frames hinged supports are arranged at two ends of the main spring a plate spring pressing plate is arranged at the upper part of the main spring and the plate spring pressing plate is fixedly connected with the rear axle through a plurality of Ushaped bolts bearing pedestals are arranged at the two ends of the torsion bar bushings are arranged in the bearing pedestals and the torsion bar is installed in the bushings Rocker arms are arranged at the two ends of the torsion bar in a frontback reverse mode the contact ends of the lower portions of the rocker arms are free ends the rocker arms do not make contact with the plate spring pressing plate when a vehicle is in a noload or lightload state the suspension system only acts on the main spring and when the vehicle reaches a certain load the rocker arms make contact with the plate spring pressingplate and the main spring and the torsion bar jointly act By the adoption of the mode that the steel plate spring main spring and the torsion rod auxiliary spring are combined the weight of the auxiliary spring in the suspension system is reduced so that the unsprung mass is reduced and the vehicle running smoothness is improved
