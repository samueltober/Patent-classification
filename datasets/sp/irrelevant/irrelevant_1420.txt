 CNA The invention discloses a formula suspension and a racing car The formula suspension comprises a wheel core a stand column guiding mechanisms a third spring and a third spring base the wheel coreand the stand column are connected the guiding mechanisms are symmetrically arranged each guiding mechanism comprises a cross arm a push rod a rocker arm and a spring shock absorber one ends ofthe cross arms are connected with the stand column through cross arm bases one ends of the push rods are hinged with the cross arm bases and the other ends are hinged with first hinge points of therocker arms one ends of the spring shock absorbers are hinged to second hinge points of the rocker arms the other ends of the spring shock absorber are used for being connected with a car frame andthe extending direction of the spring shock absorbers is perpendicular to the extending direction of the rocker arms one end of the third spring is connected with the third spring base and the extending direction of the third spring is the same as that of the spring shock absorbers two ends of the third spring base are hinged to the second hinge points of the corresponding rocker arms through third spring connecting rods correspondingly According to the formula suspension and the racing car instantaneous acceleration backward bending and instantaneous brake forward bending of the racing car can be effectively inhibited and the problem that the traditional doublespring and transverse stabilizer bar structure cannot resist pitching is solved
