 KRA The present invention relates to a rotary regenerative suspension device A vehicle suspension device having a fixed element and a moving element can include a motor that is fixed to the fixed element to generate damping force and converts the vertical displacement of the moving element into regenerative energy a gear unit that increases torque by receiving the rotational force of the motor and increases a rotational speed when regenerative energy is converted a lever arm that is coupled to the gear unit to provide damping force to the moving element and converts the vertical displacement of the moving element into rotational displacement and a link
