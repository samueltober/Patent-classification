 CNU The utility model provides a plate spring support for an air suspension Wherein the frame mounting part extends upwards the guide arm mounting part extends downwards the frame mounting part adoptsan inverted splayed frame mounting arm and the guide arm mounting part comprises a front guide arm connecting part and a rear guide arm connecting part and is used for mounting two guide arms which extend reversely along the length direction of a frame On the premise that the bearing performance and reliability are guaranteed the situation that one guide arm is correspondingly installed on an existing plate spring support is changed into the situation that two plate spring supports are installed on one plate spring support the multiple hollowedout structures are adopted the weight is reduced meanwhile the casting performance of a casting is improved materials are saved the cost is reduced and the light weight target is achieved Meanwhile an integrally cast structure is adopted forming is convenient the structure is firmer the strength of the support is improved by arranging reinforcing ribs arcshaped transition and the like interference is reduced the plate spring support is attractive in appearance more practical safer and more reliable and the service life is prolonged
