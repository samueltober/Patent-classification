 CNA The invention discloses a multistage independent suspension structure of a wheeled robot The multistage independent suspension structure comprises a suspension fixing frame and a suspension supporting base The suspension supporting base is fixedly connected with the suspension fixing frame through a multistage suspension structure The multistage suspension structure comprises at least two stages of suspensions a transition structure with a guiding function is installed between every two adjacent stages of suspensions the firststage suspension is fixedly connected with the suspensionfixing frame and the laststage suspension is connected with the suspension supporting base Each stage of suspension comprises an elastic element and at least one guide mechanism The rigidity of the elastic elements of the suspensions is sequentially reduced Load of the multistage independent suspension structure can be transmitted in a graded mode the deformation amounts of the elastic elements with different rigidity are different and therefore the adaptability and obstacle crossing performance of the wheels to the ground unevenness are improved The overall height of the wheeled robot can be kept unchanged or slightly changed under the noload condition and the heavyload condition and therefore the wheeled robot can be directly submerged into lowbottom equipment such as carsand tool cars
