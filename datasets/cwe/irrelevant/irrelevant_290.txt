 CNA The invention relates to a sealing device for a hub bearing The sealing device comprises an outer ring rigid framework an inner ring rigid framework a rubber layer and a PTFE piece The outer ringrigid framework is fixedly connected with the rubber layer One end of the rubber layer is fixedly connected with the PTFE piece The PTFE piece abuts against and is in sliding fit with the inner ringrigid framework Due to the structural form the sealing effect is ensured meanwhile the sealing performance failure caused by rubber contact abrasion in traditional sealing is avoided and therefore sealing performance is improved and meanwhile energy consumption is reduced The invention further relates to the rub bearing The hub bearing comprises a bearing outer ring a bearing inner ringa ball and a holder The sealing device for the hub bearing is adopted between the bearing inner ring and the bearing outer ring The bearing outer ring rigid framework is fixedly embedded in the bearing outer ring The bearing inner ring rigid framework is fixedly sleeved with the bearing inner ring By arranging the sealing device for the hub bearing on the hub bearing by means of the hub bearing the sealing failure caused by rubber abrasion is avoided and sealing performance is improved and meanwhile energy consumption is reduced
