 CNA The invention discloses a highcapacity multilevel hybrid clamping type capacitor voltage automatic balancing topological structure and method for driving a switched reluctance motor The structure achieves the clamping multilevel topology through an active device and a passive device and is formed by the stacking of a plurality of APtype and APtype asymmetric switched capacitor cells in a pyramid manner The maximum level number which can be generated by the phaseweighing bridge arm is the level number of the topology the M M is a positive integer level converter needs M power switch tubes and M power diodes in total and the left and right bridge arms share the capacitor closest to the directcurrent power supply side so that the N level converter needs M  M capacitors in total According to the multilevel topology disclosed by the invention a voltage balance circuit does not need to be additionally arranged and the balance of the neutral point potential and the capacitor voltage can be realized so that a multilevel topology scheme is provided for the driving of the switched reluctance motor and the problem that the capacitor voltage balance of the traditional multilevel topology for driving the switched reluctance motor is difficult to realize under the condition of high level number is solved
