 USB A support bearing of a vibration damper in the wheel suspension of a vehicle has a support bearing flange supported and forcefittingly attached on a body structure of the vehicle The support bearing flange engages around an annular elastomer element in which the damper piston rod is suspended With an annular collar which forms a hollow cylinder and the cylinder axis of which is at least approximately coincident with the longitudinal axis of the vibration damper the support bearing flange penetrates a throughopening in the body structure so far that a nut or a support bearing cover designed as a union nut is screwed on a thread provided on the outer wall of the collar With a clamping aid element interposed the nut or support bearing cover draws the support bearing flange towards the body structure in a manner supported on the body structure such that a peripheral ring section of the body structure which surrounds the throughopening is clamped between the support bearing flange and the clamping aid element and ultimately the nut or the support bearing cover As an alternative to the clamping aid element or in addition to same the collar has a shape that increases its elasticity in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the thread
