 CNU The utility model discloses an automobile frameshaped steel plate spring suspension Suspension comprising a suspension body sleeves fixedly connected with the suspension body are symmetrically arranged on the upper side of the suspension body A first sliding hole is formed in the upper end of the sleeve a sliding rod in sliding connection with the first sliding hole is inserted into the firstsliding hole the sliding rod is sleeved with a spring a connecting plate fixedly connected with the sliding rod is arranged at the end away from the sleeve of the sliding rod sliding grooves aresymmetrically formed in the upper side of the suspension body first racks slidably connected with the sliding grooves are inserted into the sliding grooves connecting rods are symmetrically arranged on the front sides of the first racks and second racks are arranged at the other ends of the connecting rods The automobile leaf spring suspension has the advantages that a traditional leaf springsuspension is improved the transmission structure replaces a transmission leaf spring assembly the problem that the stability of an automobile is insufficient due to the fact that leaf springs arenot uniform in deformation is solved meanwhile the elastic device replaces a leaf spring and therefore the bearing capacity of the suspension is improved
