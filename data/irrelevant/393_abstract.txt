The invention discloses a power dynamic distribution control method for a mediumvoltage ACDC converter The method comprises the following steps calculating a threephase total output power reference value of the converter according to the difference between a reference value and an actual value of the output directcurrent voltage of the converter calculating a dynamic distribution coefficient of threephase power according to a threephase power grid voltage and a given power factor angle calculating an output power reference value of each phase according to the threephase total outputpower reference value and a threephase power dynamic distribution coefficient and calculating a reference value of the output power of each DCDC submodule according to the number of cascaded submodules of each phase and calculating the phase shift angle of each DCDC submodule by using a proportionalintegralresonance controller according to the difference between the reference value andthe actual value of the output power of each DCDC submodule and generating a switching signal of each DCDC submodule by using a carrier phase shift modulation algorithm By using the power distribution control method the doublefrequency fluctuation of the capacitor voltage of the mediumvoltage ACDC converter can be eliminated the size of the device can be remarkably reduced and the power density of the system can be improved
