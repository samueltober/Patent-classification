The invention relates to a loss optimization control method for a modular multilevel converter which aims at minimizing the loss of a switch and a diode under a submodule of the modular multilevel converter A bridge arm current expression is obtained by combining the power balance relation the power angle relation and the circulating current mathematical model of the modular multilevel converter according to given active power and reactive power under constraint conditions of amplitude and phase of secondary circulation injection different loss values of four power devices in the submodule under various different secondary circulation currents are obtained according to a power loss formula the maximum value is selected to construct a data set and a minimum loss value is found in the data set and the second harmonic amplitude and phase of the loss value are selected as the amplitude and phase of the optimal secondary circulating current and the corresponding optimal secondary circulating current is injected into the three phases According to the invention the loss value of the device with the maximum loss power can be reduced the peak value of bridge arm current can be reduced and the reliability of the system is improved
