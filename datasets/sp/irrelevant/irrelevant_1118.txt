 CNU The utility model provides a sleeve rod structure for an automobile shock absorber The utility model relates to the technical field of automobile shock absorbers the bottom end of the inner shaft issleeved with an outer sleeve a welding block integrated with the outer sleeve is fixed at the bottom end of the outer sleeve the inner sides of the outer sleeve and the welding block are welded with the inner shaft a side plate is welded to the left side of the outer sleeve the tray has excellent supporting performance the tray is not easily pressed by the suspension to deform extending theservice life of a tray the disc sleeves the top end of the inner shaft the disc is fixedly connected with the inner shaft supporting rods are welded to the four sides of the top of the disc Traysare welded at the top ends of the struts the bearing is fixed to play a role in bearing the ball no abrasion exists between the tire rotating shaft and the inner shaft and normal rotation of the tire rotating shaft is not influenced the problem that the tray is easily influenced by vibration of a suspension to deform is solved the service life of a traditional shock absorber tray is short the rotating shaft of the tire structure still needs to rotate in the state that the rotating shaft is inserted into a shock absorber and therefore the shock absorber is greatly abraded is solved
