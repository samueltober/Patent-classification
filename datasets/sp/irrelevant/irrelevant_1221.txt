 USB A stability control system that detects a change in a vehicle operating characteristic and sends a stabilizing command to an actuator system based on identifying the change is described The actuator system applies a first magnetic field having a predetermined strength to an electropermanent magnet for a predetermined duration based on receiving the stabilizing command The first magnetic field transitions the electropermanent magnet from a first state to a second state The electropermanent magnet generates a second magnetic field in the second state The second magnetic field modifies at least one of a spring constant or a mechanical resistance of a suspension component within a suspension system of the vehicle and the electropermanent magnet retains the second state after the predetermined duration in absence of the first magnetic field
