 JPB To provide a wheel support device capable of measuring a connection part easily and directly and performing the measurement precisely and stably in an inspection process before connection by forming the connection part of a constant velocity joint with a hub unit as a relatively simple shapeSOLUTION A wheel support device  of a vehicle connects a hub unit  to which a wheel is attached and a constant velocity joint  which is provided on an end part of a drive shaft  along a center axis CL mutually and rotatably supports the wheel in such a condition as to be capable of transmitting torque from the drive shaft An outer ring  of the constant velocity joint  includes a central convex part  which protrudes on a hub wheel  side and a plurality of outside convex parts  which are disposed around it The hub wheel  includes a central concave part  which opens on the outer ring  side and is fitted in such a condition that the central convex part  abuts on a bottom surface a and a plurality of outside concave parts  which are disposed around its opening and in which the plurality of outside convex parts  are fitted to each otherSELECTED DRAWING Figure
