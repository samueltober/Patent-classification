 CNB The invention discloses a vehicle active suspension control method for longitudinal preview of singleline laser radars Through two singlewire laser radars installed at the wheel axis positions on both sides of the front of a vehicle longitudinal rotating scanning is carried out the returned point cloud data is fused with measurement data of a GPS an air pressure sensor and an inertial navigation system and converted to a WGS coordinate system and outlier filtering and continuous point cloud data are performed to form continuous road surface elevation information before the travel trajectory of the vehicle and at the same time the measurement data of the GPS and the inertial navigation system are fused to obtain the twodimensional earth coordinate value of the wheel landing location and the vehicle active suspension control quantity is obtained by matching the vehicle front trajectory road surface elevation information According to the vehicle active suspension control method for the longitudinal preview of the singleline laser radars through the longitudinal rotating scanning mode of the singleline laser radars massive redundant terrain data other than the traveltrajectory of the vehicle are avoided and the realtime performance of suspension control is improved and in addition according to the data fusion of the GPS and the inertial navigation system the earth coordinate value of the wheel landing location is accurately obtained and the accuracy of the vehicle suspension control quantity is improved
