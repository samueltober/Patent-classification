 USA A suspension system for a vehicle includes at least two torsion bars each of which are connected on their first end to respective wheel suspensions that are arranged on opposite lateral sides of the vehicle Movement of the wheel suspensions produces torque in the respective torsion bars Each of the torsion bars are connected on their second ends to a frame of the vehicle through a damper system Movement of the wheel suspensions produces torque in the respective torsion bar The damper system selectively applies resistance to the torque in the torsion bars to selectively provide active variable spring rates to the wheel suspension which application of resistance may be coordinated amongst the various torsion bars to inhibit roll of the vehicle during a turning maneuver or to increase occupant comfort when the vehicle encounters a bump or hole
