 EPB One object of the present invention is to provide a wheel bearing apparatus which can protect the magnetic encoder with improving the sealability of the fitting portion between the protecting cover and the outer member as well as can improve the accuracy and reliability of rotation speed detection with considering the deformation of the protecting cover and limiting the increase of air gap According to the present invention there is provided a wheel bearing apparatus characterized in that the protecting cover is formed of nonmagnetic steel sheet as having a cupshaped configuration by press working and comprises a cylindrical fitting portion pressfitted into the inner circumference of the innerside end of the outer member a discshaped shielding portion extending radially inward from the fitting portion via a radially reducing portion and the innerside surface of the shielding portion being adapted to be arranged closely to or contacted with a rotation speed detecting sensor and a bottom portion continuous to the shielding portion via a stepped portion to close the innerside end of the inner member and that a full deflection of the side surface of the shielding portion caused by a load same as that applied to the protecting cover when it is pressfitted into the outer member is limited to a predetermined value or less
