 CNA The invention discloses a box type outer sealing structure of a hub bearing unit and relates to the field of hub bearings The box type outer sealing structure comprises an inner framework and an outer framework the inner framework is tightly attached to the outer diameter of an outer ring and the end face of the outer ring the outer framework is provided with a bottom face which is tightly attached to the outer diameter of a flange and a straight face which is tightly attached to the end face of the flange the bottom face and the straight face are perpendicular to each other and are in arc transition the straight face extends upwards in the direction of the end face of the flange the top of the straight face inclines towards the inner framework to form a slope the top of the slopeextends upwards to form an upward fold the top of the inner framework is folded upwards to form an inwardsfolded structure an inner fold extends towards the flange side in the axis direction of theouter ring an inner rubber wraps the periphery of the inner framework and is adhered into a whole through glue joint and at most two contact type lips are arranged on the inner rubber and used forbeing matched with the outer framework The box type outer sealing structure of the hub bearing unit has high sealing performance invasion resistance of external muddy water under various working conditions is met the antileakage capability on lubricating grease in the interior of a bearing is high and a twolip contact type structure is adopted so that the friction level of the bearing is greatly reduced
