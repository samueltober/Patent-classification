 CNB The invention provides a selfadaptive suspension chassis system based on a mechanical connecting rod mechanism and belongs to the technical field of robot chassis The selfadaptive suspension chassis system comprises a completely nonindependent connecting rod suspension a chassis frame and four Mecanum wheel sets the completely nonindependent connecting rods are suspended on the chassis frame and a connecting rod type spring damping device is arranged on the completely nonindependent connecting rod suspension wherein the two Mecanum wheel sets are symmetrically installed on one sideof the chassis frame and connected with the completely nonindependent connecting rods in a suspended mode through the connecting rod type spring damping devices respectively and the other two Mecanum wheel sets are symmetrically installed on the other side of the chassis frame and connected with the completely nonindependent connecting rods in a suspended mode through the connecting rod type spring damping devices respectively The connecting rod type spring damping device is adopted so that the system can adapt to various special terrains the phenomena of shaking and inclining caused bythe fact that the adjacent wheels move in the same direction during speed changing and turning are effectively avoided and the system is high in impact resistance stable in connection and high in practicability
