 CNU The utility model relates to a load carrying AGV and a damping mechanism applied to a steering wheel the load carrying AGV comprises an installation support and a damping assembly the installation support comprises an installation plate and an installation convex lug the installation convex lug is hinged to a main supporting frame through a hinge assembly the damping assembly comprises a damping pipe a damping spring and a spring top block and the damping pipe is arranged above the installation plate The damping spring is arranged in the damping pipe the spring ejector block is arranged at one end of the damping pipe and abuts against the damping spring and the end extending out of the damping pipe of the spring ejector block is used for abutting against the main supporting frame When the vehicle runs to the ground protruding upwards or recessed downwards the steering wheel assembly is lifted or swung downwards the damping spring is compressed or elongated in length thedamping spring forms torque with the hinge assembly as a base point and the torque enables force applied to the mounting plate by the damping spring to be balanced with force applied to the steeringwheel assembly by the ground The shock absorption amplitude is more obvious the shock absorption mechanism is more suitable for the condition of large gradient and the whole shock absorption mechanism is more flexible
