 CNA     The present invention relates to the technical field of air suspension in particular to a nontransverse singleaxle twoairbag air suspension which includes a frame a load plate an airbag mechanism a support device a shock absorber and a bearing shaft The bearing is set directly under the frame Two sets of loadbearing plates are set symmetrically at both ends of the bearing shaft the middle of the loadbearing plate is set with an airbag mechanism two sets of support devices with fixed functions are set symmetrically at both ends of the load board and shock absorbers are set on the support devices when the airbag mechanism lifts the frame After finishing start the rotating cylinder the rotating cylinder will rotate the elliptical block through shaft  The rotation of the elliptical block will squeeze plate one and plate two make plate one and plate two move back and plate one pulls the other group through rod one The snap ring the plate  directly pushes a set of snap rings so that the two sets of snap rings clamp the guide post After the guide post is fixed the shock absorber has a certain shock absorption effect on the frame and at the same time the guide post The impact force acts as a buffer
