 JPA     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED To provide a preload inspection method capable of easily calculating a preload load not only in an assembly process but also in a state after assembly is completed As a result a preload inspection method that enables a simple pass  fail judgment of the preload state is provided    SOLUTION A relative distance acquisition step S for continuously acquiring a relative distance D between an outer member  and an inner member  while gradually increasing an axial pressing load Fa that sandwiches an outer member  and an inner member  And the pressing load acquisition step S to identify the turning point Pai on the transition line L of the relative distance D acquired in the relative distance acquisition step S and acquire the pressing load Fai at the turning point Pai and the pressing load acquisition Pass  fail is determined by whether or not the preload load F calculated in the preload calculation step S and the preload calculation step S for calculating the preload load F based on the pressing load Fai acquired in the step S are within the allowable range It is provided with a pass  fail judgment step S
