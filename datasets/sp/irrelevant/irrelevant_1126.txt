 CNU The utility model belongs to the technical field of vehicle bushings The utility model relates to a bushing in particular to a highbearing rear swing arm bushing Including an inner barrel the outer surface of the inner cylinder is fixedly connected with a limiting block the outer surface of the limiting block is trapezoidal a bushing is arranged on the outer surface of the inner cylinder and a first limiting opening is formed in the inner surface of the lining the outer surface of the limiting block is slidably connected with the inner wall of the first limiting opening in an insertedmode a first wearresisting layer is fixedly connected to the inner surface of the lining a first mounting opening is formed in the surface of one side of the first wearresisting layer and one end of the first mounting opening extends into the lining According to the highbearingcapacity rear swing arm bushing the effect of dissipating heat in the bushing is achieved and therefore the problems that in the using process of an existing swing arm bushing due to friction between the bushing and a swing arm the bushing can generate a large amount of heat the bushing can be damaged aftera long time and the using efficiency of the bushing is reduced are solved
