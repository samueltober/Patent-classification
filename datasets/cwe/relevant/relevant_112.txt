 CNA A method for manufacturing a bearing device for a wheel the method having a step for expanding an opening hole formed in an outerside end portion of an outer member by pressing the opening hole from the inside using a forging process thereby forming a thickwalled portion bulging radially outward on the outer periphery of the outer member the thickwalled portion being formed on the outer periphery of the outer member and the thickwalled portion being formed on the outer periphery of the outer member the outer member is pressed between a first die axially facing the outer side end portion and a second die axially located at the outer side end portion to form the thick portion whereby the first die is pressed against a first side of the knuckle attachment flange extending in the radial direction the second die is not in contact with a second side extending in the radial direction of the knuckle mounting flange the second side is axially opposite to the first side and the second side is not in contact when pressed
