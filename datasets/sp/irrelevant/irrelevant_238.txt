 USB An electromechanical roll stabilizer for a motor vehicle includes a housing a rotor position sensor board and an actuator torque sensor board The housing has a motor unit that has a stator and a rotor integrated therein The rotor position sensor board and the actuator torque sensor board are arranged between two stabilizer halves The actuator torque sensor board has a digitization and transmission unit for digitizing the sensed torque and transmitting the digitized torque to a data forwarding module arranged on the rotor position sensor board The rotor position sensor board has a rotor position detection unit for sensing and digitizing the rotor position and a data processing unit The sensing of the rotor position can be triggered by at least one command signal of a controller to the rotor position detection unit The data processing unit is provided to process the sensed measured values
