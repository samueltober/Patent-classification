The Kappa converter circuit as introduced herein can be configured for stepdown buck stepup boost or buckboost operation The Kappa converter circuit exhibits lower electromagnetic interference EMI relative to other buck boost or buckboost topologies such as without additional input or output filter circuits The Kappa converter circuit can have high power handling capability and less DCR loss for example due to a distribution of current signals through respective inductors The Kappa converter circuit includes isolating inductors at its input and ground reference nodes to help reduce signal bounce or signal pulsations at supply and ground reference busses thereby further reducing EMI noise due to switching in the circuit When the Kappa converter is configured for stepup operation the converter exhibits no righthalfplane RHP zero
