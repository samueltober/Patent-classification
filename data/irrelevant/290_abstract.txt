The invention discloses a multiphase critical conduction power converter and a control method thereof The singlephase critical conduction converter is extended to multiphase and the enabling of multiple power stage circuits is controlled with the change of the load current State so that when the load current changes the switching frequency can be maintained within a predetermined range It solves the shortcomings of low operating frequency and large conduction current of the singlephase critical conduction mode converter under heavy load at the same time it also solves the problem of higher operating frequency and higher efficiency of the multiphase critical conduction mode converter under light load Disadvantages of getting lower At the same time when the singlephase light load the working frequency of the singlephase converter is reduced through the current discontinuous mode so that the multiphase converter can maintain efficient operation in the entire load range
