The invention relates to a centrosymmetric IGBT multimodule parallel connection device which comprises a plurality of IGBT modules a laminated busbar a heat dissipation plate and a supporting plate wherein the IGBT modules the laminated busbar the heat dissipation plate and the supporting plate form a compact STACK layout so that the modular design is realized the design of a highpower converter becomes simpler the STACK heat dissipation performance is optimized through the center hollowedout design of the laminated busbar the heat dissipation plate and the supporting plate the overall power connection layout is in central symmetry electromagnetic coupling generated when the IGBT module is switched on and off is reduced in addition through the terminal layout of the laminated busbar the parasitic impedance of each current branch is balanced the current balance degree between the IGBT modules connected in parallel is improved expandability is achieved and seriesparallel connection between STACKs is easier to achieve
