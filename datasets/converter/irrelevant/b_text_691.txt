 CNA The invention discloses a satelliteborne multimode photoelectric imaging device and imaging method relates to the technical field of photoelectric remote sensing imaging and solves the problem that a camera system adopting a detector in the prior art cannot have two different imaging modes at the same time The photosensitive surface of the highframefrequency area array CMOS photoelectric detector is plated with a panchromatic Bayer template and a hyperspectral optical film with n spectrum bands The FPGA device outputs a driving time sequence of the highframefrequency area array CMOSphotoelectric detector performs parameter setting and reading on an internal register receives highspeed image data output by the detector outputs an image data stream of a corresponding AOI window in a video mode performs digital domain TDI algorithm processing on cached image data in a pushbroom mode and outputs a highspeed image data stream of a corresponding AOI window in a pushbroommode the corresponding row of image data is accumulated row by row and finally the image data is output row by row Imaging is carried out in a video mode or a pushbroom mode three kinds of spectral information including panchromatic spectral information colorful spectral information and hyperspectral information are covered and dynamic image data and static image data with multidimensionalspectral information are obtained
