According to the present invention a voltage evaluation value generation unit  receives the detected values of voltages Vc of power storage elements of all converter cells constituting a power converter and generates a voltage evaluation value Vcg of each of the power storage elements of all the converter cells the voltage evaluation value being different from the average value of all the detected values Further the voltage evaluation value generation unit  generates the voltage evaluation value Vcg of each of power storage elements of a plurality of converter cells included in each of a plurality of groups obtained by dividing all the converter cells in advance without using the average value of the detected values of the voltages Vc of the power storage elements of said plurality of converter cells A voltage macro control unit  uses the voltage evaluation value Vcg to calculate a control value Izref to be commonly set for a plurality of converter cells of at least the same group for controlling the excess or deficiency of the stored energy of all the converter cells and the converter cells of each group
