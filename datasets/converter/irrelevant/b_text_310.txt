 WOA An electric converter for converting AC or DC input into an electric AC or DC output A swap circuit with controllable electric switches serves to selectively swap connection of a plurality of DC power banks DCBs between an input terminal and an output terminal thus selectively connecting the DCBs to an electric source or an electric load The DCBs are formed as series of interconnected submodules SMs each having one or more electric energy storage elements ESEs and a switching circuit for selectively bypassing or connecting the ESEs The ESEs can be capacitors batteries super capacitors or a combination of these By properly controlling the swap circuit and the switching of the SMs such as by taking into account the deadtime for the electric switches involved the converter can be used for DCAC DCDC ACDC or ACAC conversion allowing multilevel output It can in some embodiments eliminate the need for an unfolding converter and the converter provides a rather simple and efficient topology suitable eg for connection of a DC input from a photovoltaic elements to an AC electric grid
