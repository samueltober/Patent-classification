 CNU The utility model discloses a suspension system and an automobile The suspension system comprises an axle assembly a spiral spring assembly a steel plate spring a watt rod a transverse pull roda longitudinal pull rod and a Vshaped pull rod When the load is small an elastic element of the automobile is mainly a spiral spring assembly and the whole automobile has high riding comfort whenthe load is close to the maximum design load the spiral spring is pressed to the limit position at the moment the rigidity of the spiral spring is greatly equivalent to that of a rigid connectingpiece and at the moment the highrigidity steel plate spring serves as an elastic element to bear the load and has high bearing capacity Compared with the prior art the device is simple in structure and free of a spring eye structure and the spring eye at the fixed end is prevented from being broken The longitudinal pull rod and the Vshaped pull rod bear the Xdirection load of the automobile the longitudinal pull rods the Vshaped pull rods and the transverse pull rods jointly bear Ydirection loads of an automobile when wheels deflect the force can play a role in deviation rectification and the straightline driving capacity is improved
