The invention relates to a power converter having a threephase alternating current input and output L L L N a first power converter stage  having a first input and output and a second input and output   an intermediate circuit  a second power converter stage  having a first input and output   and a second input and output   and a direct current output A wherein the first input and output of the first power converter stage  is electrically connected to the threephase alternating current input and output L L L N and the second input and output   of the first power converter stage  is electrically connected to the intermediate circuit  Power converters are used in charging devices for electrical vehicles Known transformerless power converters currently require many power electronic stages for charging electric vehicles on singlephase alternating current grids twophase alternating current grids and threephase alternating current grids and therefore charging devices for universal use on single two or threephase alternating current grids are costly Therefore there is demand for a costeffective and compact charging device for electric vehicles Compensating currents which can flow into the vehicle as a result of parasitic leakage capacitances of the battery or other components should be suppressed in order not to adversely influence the functionality of protection devices against electrical danger to people Circuit parts required for single and multiphase operation should be used in different functions depending on operating mode in order to minimize the expense for the charging device
